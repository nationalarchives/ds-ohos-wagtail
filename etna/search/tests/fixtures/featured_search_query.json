                    "value": "<span class=\"wrapper\"><p>1826- 2005</p> <p>Born in 1826 in Nuneaton, Job Wheway (1826-1903) was the youngest of three sons. He found his way to Walsall where he learned the trade of the blacksmith. He married and with his wife, Eliza, had 3 daughters and in 1857, a son, Sydney Benjamin (1857-1944).</p> <p>Living in Newhall Street, Caldmore, Walsall, Job Wheway built a blacksmith's hearth in the brewhouse and used it as his first forge for creating small hand forgings. With his wife's help the business prospered and they moved to larger premises at 38 Sandwell Street, Caldmore.</p> <p>Throughout the 1860s the business continued to grow and outgrew the Sandwell Street premises. At some time during this period Job Wheway took the opportunity to take over the trace halter chains and cart hames manufacturer, 'John Webster and &amp; Son', in Green Lane, Walsall. This site became known as 'Birchills Hame and Chain Works'.</p> <p>Having finished his education at Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall, c1877, Job Wheway took his son, Sydney Benjamin, into the business and it became known as 'Job Wheway and Son'.</p> <p>In 1894 the father and son bought cart hame manufacturer 'S Marsh &amp; Son' of West Bromwich, for £100. This subsidiary became known as 'S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works'. Within a few years the Green Lane Factory and S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works, West Bromwich, were the largest of their kind in the country.</p> <p>In January 1899, at the age of 73, Job retired and gave the business in its entirety to Sydney Benjamin. Sydney Benjamin and his wife Mary had five sons; Sydney Gell, later to be a Director of the company; Harold Job, forced to retire early from wounds sustained in WW1; William Reginald, later to be MD of the company; George Doughty, who became a barrister and played no part in the firm; Charles Gell, who later managed the S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works subsidiary in West Bromwich. The family were appointed on numerous occasions to the positions of 'President of Walsall Chamber of Commerce', 'Justice of the Peace', and Mayor of Walsall.</p> <p>Sydney Benjamin travelled widely in search of business - Australia, the US, Canada, many European countries, New Zealand and Africa. In 1900 he invested huge amounts of money in installing plant to produce 'chain welded by electricity'. By 1902 the new plant was in production and the first electrically welded chain ever to be produced in the UK was despatched from the Green Lane factory.</p> <p>In 1910 the firm produced the dog trace chains for Captain Scott's Antarctic Expedition. These are still thought to be buried under the ice.</p> <p>In 1912 Sydney Benjamin acquired competitor 'James Gnosill &amp; Son', a Walsall-based cart gear manufacturers.</p> <p>The outbreak of World War One caused a tremendous increase in demand for hames and harness gear as the army was still very dependent on horse-drawn transport for supply wagons and gun carriages, and the Wheway factories were put on war footing. The work force was increased to 450 and the working day was extended from 7am to 8pm. Production of hames was soon at 600 pairs per week with harness gears to match.</p> <p>By 1917 Sydney Benjamin was 60 years old. He made the firm a joint stock company and made his third son, William Reginald, joint Managing Director with himself. The firms name became 'Job Wheway &amp; Son Limited'. By 1920 the two brothers, William Reginald and Sydney Gell, were effectively running the company, William Reginald as MD, Charles Gell managing the S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works subsidiary.</p> <p>Hame trade was declining as the motorcar industry grew. Car bumpers were not fitted as standard and had to be bought separately, and so the S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works started to produce them. William Reginald visited Sir Herbert Austin at Longbridge to introduce his bumpers but arrived in an American car and was allegedly asked to leave. Manufacturers soon started to fit bumpers as standard, signalling the end of the bumper trade for Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd.</p> <p>In 1925 the S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works at West Bromwich, closed due to a shortage of work, and all hame production was concentrated on the Green Lane factory. The firm continued on full employment producing its range of high-specification products right through the depression of the late 1920s and early 30s.</p> <p>In 1939 Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd took over hame-maker, 'Parkes &amp; Gnosill' of Regent Street, Walsall. All hame production was transferred to the Parkes &amp; Gnosill factory, leaving the Green Lane factory to concentrate on chain production.</p> <p>The outbreak of World War Two generated an increase in demand for high quality chain. The firm was put under control of the Admiralty and production was rapidly increased. Amongst other things the firm produced chain flails which were fitted to booms projecting well in front of tanks in the North African desert. The flails were used to detonate land mines. The firm also produced anchor chains for the many Sunderland Flying Boats stationed around the coast.</p> <p>In August 1944 William's eldest son, William Derek, was killed on active service. He had worked for the family firm, in the non-skid tyre chain section, for a year after leaving school. He volunteered for the Fleet Air Arm in 1942 and he was killed just 2 years later. In October of the same year Sydney Benjamin Wheway died at the age of 88.</p> <p>In 1948 the UK coal industry embarked on a massive mechanisation programme. The new machines needed very high quality chain both to transport the coal in armoured conveyors and to haul the machines themselves. The firm found good long-term markets in supplying mining chain both in this country and abroad.</p> <p>In 1949 the Wheway family decided to form the firm into a public limited company. 760,000 Ordinary one-shilling shares were offered at three shillings each. The offer was quickly taken up and the firm floated on the 30th Sept 1949.</p> <p>The Wheway firm was also influential in the development of industrial standards and specifications. In 1950 a British Standard Specification (BS1663) was published with the firm's participation. It detailed a grade 40 chain made from a higher carbon-steel, some 33% stronger than chains previously manufactured. In 1959 another British Standard Specification was published, again with the firm's full participation (BS3113). This BS specified a Grade 60 chain made from alloy steel of twice the strength of pre-war chains. By 1981 a third British Standard Specification was published (BS4942) in conjunction with Wheway. This BS specified a Grade 80 (now known internationally as Grade T).</p> <p>In September 1957 William Reginald Wheway died aged 65, after 48 years and 8 months service with the firm. His brother, Sydney, also died in the same year. William Reginald Wheway's son, Robert A Wheway (known as Robin), was appointed as Chairman and Joint Managing Director, and Sydney Gell Wheway's son, Sydney W P Wheway (known as Tim), joined the Board of Directors.</p> <p>In 1959 an informal partnership with Glasgow-based chain makers Watson &amp; McLean began. Watson &amp; McLean made heavier sized chain whilst Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd concentrated on the lighter sizes. The co-operation was formalised in November 1959 when the Board of Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd instructed 'Neville Industrial Securities Ltd' to make an offer on behalf of the Company to the shareholders of Watson &amp; McLean Ltd, to acquire the whole of the issued share capital of Watson &amp; McLean in exchange for shares in Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd. The two firms amalgamated into one and became 'Wheway, Watson &amp; McLean Limited', the name shortening in 1965 to 'Wheway Watson Ltd'.</p> <p>The Board of Wheway Watson &amp; McLean Ltd did not support Mr R A Wheway as Chairman and a decision was eventually reached that Mr R A Wheway would step down as Chairman and Managing Director. In 1966 the two Wheway cousins, Robin and Tim, both left the firm, thus terminating its one hundred year association with the Wheway family.</p> <p>Around 1960, Wheway Watson &amp; McLean Ltd became a Holding Company controlling the three trading companies which formed the Group, namely, 1) Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd 2) Watson &amp; McLean Ltd, Govan, Scotland 3) Mechanical Equipments Ltd, Morley &amp; Leeds, Yorks, which had been acquired in September 1959.</p> <p>In 1961 Wheway Watson &amp; McLean Ltd made an offer for the share capital of Weldless Chains Ltd, finally acquiring the company in 1962.</p> <p>In September of 1964, in order to facilitate the establishment of separate testing and repair depots in the Midland and London areas, a new, wholly owned subsidiary was registered under the name of Wheway Watson (Midlands) Ltd.</p> <p>In December of 1964, Wheway Watson &amp; McLean Ltd purchased the whole of the issued share capital of Carr Bros. (Engineers) Ltd of Beckenham, Kent. The name of this company was subsequently changed to Wheway Watson (London) Ltd. The purchase created a convenient test base for the area.</p> <p>In 1965 American company 'Columbus McKinnon Corporation', who were in-part engaged in chain making, took a substantial holding in, what was now named Wheway Watson Ltd. Part of the deal was the provision of advanced chain making machines which kept the firm abreast of the latest technology. The firm's name was amended to 'Wheway Watson (CM) Ltd' to acknowledge the new situation.</p> <p>The firm continued in business and on October 1st 1974 its name changed to Wheway Watson Holdings Ltd and from this date the three trading divisions of the company operated as subsidiary companies. The subsidiaries had their own boards of directors and company offices located at Walsall, Warley and Kingston-Upon-Thames.</p> <p>In 1975 the subsidiary companies were listed as;</p> <p>§ Wheway Watson (CM) Ltd</p> <p>based at Walsall, this was the former Chain Division of the Company</p> <p>§ Felco Hoists Ltd</p> <p>hand and electric hoists marketed under the Felco brand name</p> <p>§ Wheway Watson (ME) Ltd</p> <p>this subsidiary comprised the six units originally operated under the General Division.</p> <p>By 1978 the firm's head office transferred from Hillington, Glasgow, to Erdington, Birmingham.</p> <p>Further restructuring occurred in 1980 with the formation of seven separate operating companies under the Wheway Watson Holdings Ltd title;</p> <p>§ Holdings</p> <p>§ Chain Division</p> <p>§ Hoist Division</p> <p>§ Marine Division</p> <p>§ Forging Division</p> <p>§ General Division</p> <p>§ Lifting Engineering Division</p> <p>During this period, UK and Worldwide recession occurred, and demand from the National Coal Board was vastly reduced. As a result, in 1981, in order to cut costs, the head office in Erdington was sold and the firm moved to smaller premises.</p> <p>In 1982 the company re-registered as a public limited company and became Wheway Watson Holdings PLC.</p> <p>The Chain Divisions and, to a lesser extent, the Hoist and Mechanical Handling Division, were major suppliers to the National Coal Board and accordingly were affected by the ban on overtime imposed by the National Union of Mineworkers in October 1983, which developed into a strike in March 1984. The firm adopted practices of short-time working, changes in working practices, and redundancies to try and keep afloat.</p> <p>By 1984 two of the six units of the Mechanical Handling Division were the subject of management buy-outs and were sold at a loss.</p> <p>In November of 1984 Wheway Watson (CM) Ltd commenced trading as a wholly owned subsidiary in its own right. However, by 1985 50% of this chainmaking operation was sold to German manufacturing group Becker Pruente GmbH, and Wheway Watson (CM) Ltd became known as Wheway Becker.</p> <p>By 1985, as a result of the difficulties caused by having business based predominantly within one sector during the recession, Wheway Becker moved into the product design, distribution, service and manufacturing businesses.

                  "administrativeBackground": "<span class=\"wrapper\"><p>1826- 2005</p> <p>Born in 1826 in Nuneaton, Job Wheway (1826-1903) was the youngest of three sons. He found his way to Walsall where he learned the trade of the blacksmith. He married and with his wife, Eliza, had 3 daughters and in 1857, a son, Sydney Benjamin (1857-1944).</p> <p>Living in Newhall Street, Caldmore, Walsall, Job Wheway built a blacksmith's hearth in the brewhouse and used it as his first forge for creating small hand forgings. With his wife's help the business prospered and they moved to larger premises at 38 Sandwell Street, Caldmore.</p> <p>Throughout the 1860s the business continued to grow and outgrew the Sandwell Street premises. At some time during this period Job Wheway took the opportunity to take over the trace halter chains and cart hames manufacturer, 'John Webster and &amp; Son', in Green Lane, Walsall. This site became known as 'Birchills Hame and Chain Works'.</p> <p>Having finished his education at Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall, c1877, Job Wheway took his son, Sydney Benjamin, into the business and it became known as 'Job Wheway and Son'.</p> <p>In 1894 the father and son bought cart hame manufacturer 'S Marsh &amp; Son' of West Bromwich, for £100. This subsidiary became known as 'S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works'. Within a few years the Green Lane Factory and S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works, West Bromwich, were the largest of their kind in the country.</p> <p>In January 1899, at the age of 73, Job retired and gave the business in its entirety to Sydney Benjamin. Sydney Benjamin and his wife Mary had five sons; Sydney Gell, later to be a Director of the company; Harold Job, forced to retire early from wounds sustained in WW1; William Reginald, later to be MD of the company; George Doughty, who became a barrister and played no part in the firm; Charles Gell, who later managed the S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works subsidiary in West Bromwich. The family were appointed on numerous occasions to the positions of 'President of Walsall Chamber of Commerce', 'Justice of the Peace', and Mayor of Walsall.</p> <p>Sydney Benjamin travelled widely in search of business - Australia, the US, Canada, many European countries, New Zealand and Africa. In 1900 he invested huge amounts of money in installing plant to produce 'chain welded by electricity'. By 1902 the new plant was in production and the first electrically welded chain ever to be produced in the UK was despatched from the Green Lane factory.</p> <p>In 1910 the firm produced the dog trace chains for Captain Scott's Antarctic Expedition. These are still thought to be buried under the ice.</p> <p>In 1912 Sydney Benjamin acquired competitor 'James Gnosill &amp; Son', a Walsall-based cart gear manufacturers.</p> <p>The outbreak of World War One caused a tremendous increase in demand for hames and harness gear as the army was still very dependent on horse-drawn transport for supply wagons and gun carriages, and the Wheway factories were put on war footing. The work force was increased to 450 and the working day was extended from 7am to 8pm. Production of hames was soon at 600 pairs per week with harness gears to match.</p> <p>By 1917 Sydney Benjamin was 60 years old. He made the firm a joint stock company and made his third son, William Reginald, joint Managing Director with himself. The firms name became 'Job Wheway &amp; Son Limited'. By 1920 the two brothers, William Reginald and Sydney Gell, were effectively running the company, William Reginald as MD, Charles Gell managing the S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works subsidiary.</p> <p>Hame trade was declining as the motorcar industry grew. Car bumpers were not fitted as standard and had to be bought separately, and so the S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works started to produce them. William Reginald visited Sir Herbert Austin at Longbridge to introduce his bumpers but arrived in an American car and was allegedly asked to leave. Manufacturers soon started to fit bumpers as standard, signalling the end of the bumper trade for Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd.</p> <p>In 1925 the S Marsh &amp; Son Patent Hame Works at West Bromwich, closed due to a shortage of work, and all hame production was concentrated on the Green Lane factory. The firm continued on full employment producing its range of high-specification products right through the depression of the late 1920s and early 30s.</p> <p>In 1939 Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd took over hame-maker, 'Parkes &amp; Gnosill' of Regent Street, Walsall. All hame production was transferred to the Parkes &amp; Gnosill factory, leaving the Green Lane factory to concentrate on chain production.</p> <p>The outbreak of World War Two generated an increase in demand for high quality chain. The firm was put under control of the Admiralty and production was rapidly increased. Amongst other things the firm produced chain flails which were fitted to booms projecting well in front of tanks in the North African desert. The flails were used to detonate land mines. The firm also produced anchor chains for the many Sunderland Flying Boats stationed around the coast.</p> <p>In August 1944 William's eldest son, William Derek, was killed on active service. He had worked for the family firm, in the non-skid tyre chain section, for a year after leaving school. He volunteered for the Fleet Air Arm in 1942 and he was killed just 2 years later. In October of the same year Sydney Benjamin Wheway died at the age of 88.</p> <p>In 1948 the UK coal industry embarked on a massive mechanisation programme. The new machines needed very high quality chain both to transport the coal in armoured conveyors and to haul the machines themselves. The firm found good long-term markets in supplying mining chain both in this country and abroad.</p> <p>In 1949 the Wheway family decided to form the firm into a public limited company. 760,000 Ordinary one-shilling shares were offered at three shillings each. The offer was quickly taken up and the firm floated on the 30th Sept 1949.</p> <p>The Wheway firm was also influential in the development of industrial standards and specifications. In 1950 a British Standard Specification (BS1663) was published with the firm's participation. It detailed a grade 40 chain made from a higher carbon-steel, some 33% stronger than chains previously manufactured. In 1959 another British Standard Specification was published, again with the firm's full participation (BS3113). This BS specified a Grade 60 chain made from alloy steel of twice the strength of pre-war chains. By 1981 a third British Standard Specification was published (BS4942) in conjunction with Wheway. This BS specified a Grade 80 (now known internationally as Grade T).</p> <p>In September 1957 William Reginald Wheway died aged 65, after 48 years and 8 months service with the firm. His brother, Sydney, also died in the same year. William Reginald Wheway's son, Robert A Wheway (known as Robin), was appointed as Chairman and Joint Managing Director, and Sydney Gell Wheway's son, Sydney W P Wheway (known as Tim), joined the Board of Directors.</p> <p>In 1959 an informal partnership with Glasgow-based chain makers Watson &amp; McLean began. Watson &amp; McLean made heavier sized chain whilst Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd concentrated on the lighter sizes. The co-operation was formalised in November 1959 when the Board of Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd instructed 'Neville Industrial Securities Ltd' to make an offer on behalf of the Company to the shareholders of Watson &amp; McLean Ltd, to acquire the whole of the issued share capital of Watson &amp; McLean in exchange for shares in Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd. The two firms amalgamated into one and became 'Wheway, Watson &amp; McLean Limited', the name shortening in 1965 to 'Wheway Watson Ltd'.</p> <p>The Board of Wheway Watson &amp; McLean Ltd did not support Mr R A Wheway as Chairman and a decision was eventually reached that Mr R A Wheway would step down as Chairman and Managing Director. In 1966 the two Wheway cousins, Robin and Tim, both left the firm, thus terminating its one hundred year association with the Wheway family.</p> <p>Around 1960, Wheway Watson &amp; McLean Ltd became a Holding Company controlling the three trading companies which formed the Group, namely, 1) Job Wheway &amp; Son Ltd 2) Watson &amp; McLean Ltd, Govan, Scotland 3) Mechanical Equipments Ltd, Morley &amp; Leeds, Yorks, which had been acquired in September 1959.</p> <p>In 1961 Wheway Watson &amp; McLean Ltd made an offer for the share capital of Weldless Chains Ltd, finally acquiring the company in 1962.</p> <p>In September of 1964, in order to facilitate the establishment of separate testing and repair depots in the Midland and London areas, a new, wholly owned subsidiary was registered under the name of Wheway Watson (Midlands) Ltd.</p> <p>In December of 1964, Wheway Watson &amp; McLean Ltd purchased the whole of the issued share capital of Carr Bros. (Engineers) Ltd of Beckenham, Kent. The name of this company was subsequently changed to Wheway Watson (London) Ltd. The purchase created a convenient test base for the area.</p> <p>In 1965 American company 'Columbus McKinnon Corporation', who were in-part engaged in chain making, took a substantial holding in, what was now named Wheway Watson Ltd. Part of the deal was the provision of advanced chain making machines which kept the firm abreast of the latest technology. The firm's name was amended to 'Wheway Watson (CM) Ltd' to acknowledge the new situation.</p> <p>The firm continued in business and on October 1st 1974 its name changed to Wheway Watson Holdings Ltd and from this date the three trading divisions of the company operated as subsidiary companies. The subsidiaries had their own boards of directors and company offices located at Walsall, Warley and Kingston-Upon-Thames.</p> <p>In 1975 the subsidiary companies were listed as;</p> <p>§ Wheway Watson (CM) Ltd</p> <p>based at Walsall, this was the former Chain Division of the Company</p> <p>§ Felco Hoists Ltd</p> <p>hand and electric hoists marketed under the Felco brand name</p> <p>§ Wheway Watson (ME) Ltd</p> <p>this subsidiary comprised the six units originally operated under the General Division.</p> <p>By 1978 the firm's head office transferred from Hillington, Glasgow, to Erdington, Birmingham.</p> <p>Further restructuring occurred in 1980 with the formation of seven separate operating companies under the Wheway Watson Holdings Ltd title;</p> <p>§ Holdings</p> <p>§ Chain Division</p> <p>§ Hoist Division</p> <p>§ Marine Division</p> <p>§ Forging Division</p> <p>§ General Division</p> <p>§ Lifting Engineering Division</p> <p>During this period, UK and Worldwide recession occurred, and demand from the National Coal Board was vastly reduced. As a result, in 1981, in order to cut costs, the head office in Erdington was sold and the firm moved to smaller premises.</p> <p>In 1982 the company re-registered as a public limited company and became Wheway Watson Holdings PLC.</p> <p>The Chain Divisions and, to a lesser extent, the Hoist and Mechanical Handling Division, were major suppliers to the National Coal Board and accordingly were affected by the ban on overtime imposed by the National Union of Mineworkers in October 1983, which developed into a strike in March 1984. The firm adopted practices of short-time working, changes in working practices, and redundancies to try and keep afloat.</p> <p>By 1984 two of the six units of the Mechanical Handling Division were the subject of management buy-outs and were sold at a loss.</p> <p>In November of 1984 Wheway Watson (CM) Ltd commenced trading as a wholly owned subsidiary in its own right. However, by 1985 50% of this chainmaking operation was sold to German manufacturing group Becker Pruente GmbH, and Wheway Watson (CM) Ltd became known as Wheway Becker.</p> <p>By 1985, as a result of the difficulties caused by having business based predominantly within one sector during the recession, Wheway Becker moved into the product design, distribution, service and manufacturing businesses. Non-manufacturing businesses were estimated to account for some 40% of turnover and 45% of profit during the year. Markets served were widely spread with six industries accounting for 10% or more turnover, with none above 24%. Sales to the mining industry as a percentage of total turnover fell from over 50% to approximately 14%.</p> <p>In September of 1985 the forging operation of 'Arthur Edge &amp; Co Ltd' were acquired from McLeod Russel PLC, Glasgow, in exchange for 11,300,216 ordinary shares.</p> <p>By 27 September 1985 the firm's name had changed once more, to Wheway PLC, and was listed as having the following wholly owned subsidiaries;</p> <p>HOIST AND LIFTING COMPANIES</p> <p>Felco Hoists Ltd</p> <p>Loveridge Lifting Services Ltd</p> <p>MARINE LASHINGS COMPANIES</p> <p>International Lashings Systems Ltd</p> <p>ILS (America) Incorporated</p> <p>TRANSPORT COMPANY</p> <p>W Hughes &amp; Sons (Old Hill) Ltd</p> <p>FORGING COMPANIES</p> <p>Shakespeare Forgings Ltd</p> <p>Arthur Edge &amp; Co Ltd</p> <p>Thermal Processing (Midlands) Ltd</p> <p>ENGINEERING COMPANY</p> <p>Shakespeare Engineering UK Ltd</p> <p>In June 1986 Wheway PLC acquired 'D F Bevan (Holdings) PLC'.</p> <p>As a result of continuing acquisition and rationalisation programmes, the principal activities of the group changed and were placed into three categories; design, manufacture and merchanting.</p> <p>In 1987 Wheway PLC's entry into the environmental fields of Clean Air and Environmental Engineering was initiated by the acquisition of the Wright Air Conditioning Group.</p> <p>In 1990 Wheway PLC sold their remaining 50% shareholding in Wheway Becker, signalling the end of 200 years of the firm's involvement in the chain making industry.

                  "value": "<span class=\"wrapper\"><p>Section A, Biographical, includes the draft of Mourant's autobiography, Blood and Stones published after his death in 1995, together with the correspondence and papers Mourant assembled while writing it. There is also documentation of Mourant's education at Victoria College Jersey and at Exeter College Oxford. The latter includes notes on lectures 1922-ca 1926. Documentation of Mourant's career, honours and awards is patchy, although there is material relating to his search for employment in the early 1930s. There are pocket diaries spanning 1915-1982, with a fairly continuous sequence 1922-1961. The section includes extensive family and personal correspondence, much of which dates from or relates to the German occupation of Jersey or shortly thereafter. Mourant's other documented interests include his membership of the Methodist Church and his political affiliations, the League of Nations Union in particular.</p> <p>Section B, Early career, is very slight. It is chiefly documentation of Mourant's period with the Geological Survey 1929-1931.</p> <p>Section C, Blood Group Reference Laboratory and Blood Group Centre, is not extensive. It brings together miscellaneous material relating to Mourant's service with the Medical Research Council's Blood Group Reference Laboratory based at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine and the Nuffield (later Anthropological) Blood Group Centre at the Royal Anthropological Institute, London.</p> <p>Section D, Serological Population Genetics Laboratory, is uneven in its coverage. Although there is some documentation of the foundation of the laboratory 1964-1965 and of its staff, it consists chiefly of correspondence and papers relating to Mourant's largely successful efforts to find continued funding for the Laboratory 1969-1977. Mourant approached a number of bodies, including the European Research Office of the US Army, the Nuffield Foundation, the Wolfson Foundation and the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>Section E, Haematological research, though not extensive, covers Mourant's work in a number of important areas from research on blood serum in the mid-1940s to the mapping of blood groups in the 1960s and 1970s. There are early research notes, correspondence and papers relating to student and other expeditions undertaking blood group and physical anthropology research, and some Medical Research Council material assembled by Mourant relating to projects in which he had an interest. The largest component of the section, however, is maps and data produced during preparation of the second edition of The Distribution of the Human Blood Groups.</p> <p>Section F, Publications, presents a chronological sequence of drafts and correspondence relating to Mourant's publications 1929-1991 and undated, with extensive material relating to editions of The Distribution of the Human Blood Groups and to The Genetics of the Jews (1978). There is also editorial correspondence relating to publishers and journals, chiefly invitations to review books or referee papers, and an incomplete set of offprints. Following Mourant's own practice, no attempt has been made to separate Mourant's biological and anthropological publications from his geological and archaeological ones. Where applicable reference is made to the list of Mourant's publications from his autobiography (A.1) in the form Bibliog, no... However, not all of Mourant's published work was listed in the bibliography.</p> <p>Section G, Lectures and broadcasts, presents correspondence and papers relating to some of Mourant's public and invitation lectures and broadcasts. The largest component of the section is Mourant's lectures on blood groups given at the College de France, Toulouse, 1978-1979. Not all of Mourant's lecturing is represented in this section, reference should also be made to section H. There is a little correspondence relating to broadcasts and two lectures and broadcasts by others.</p> <p>Section H, Societies and organisations, is not extensive, and is confined to brief documentation of only a few of the societies and organisations with which Mourant was associated. It includes professional and geological bodies as well as haematological, biological and medical organisations.</p> <p>Section J, Visits and conferences, covers the period 1960-1987. The visit best documented is that to North America in 1980. The section is not comprehensive and there is also considerable documentation of Mourant's visits and conferences in the papers he assembled in the course of preparing his autobiography (see NCUACS 85/6/99/A.16-NCUACS 85/6/99/A.47) and in section G, Lectures and broadcasts.</p> <p>Section K, Correspondence, is the largest in the collection. Its complexity reflects Mourant's organisation of the material. The bulk of it was found in three main series: 'Foreign 1965-1977', 'Biological' and 'Geological', together with a fragment of a fourth series 'Home 1965-1977'. In addition to the material preserved in these four series, Mourant kept separate files for some correspondents and some correspondence was found loose. This additional correspondence is presented in three artificial series titled 'Other biological correspondence', 'Other geological correspondence' and 'References and recommendations'. As Mourant's arrangement has been retained correspondents can appear in two or more series without any distinction in terms of subject or date. Principal correspondents include C.C. Blackwell, B. Bonn, O.J. Brendemoen, V.A. Clarke, L.L. Cavalli-Sforza, A. W. Eriksson, T.J. Greenwalt, J.K. Moor-Jankowski, T. Jenkins, W.S. Pollitzer, D.F. Roberts, J. Ruffí, D. Tills and J.S. Weiner.</p></span>"

                    "value": "<span class=\"wrapper\"><p>Mourant was born on 11 April 1904 in Jersey. He was educated at Victoria College, Jersey before winning a King Charles I Scholarship to Exeter College Oxford where he read Chemistry. He graduated with a first class degree, taking crystallography as his special subject, and in 1926 went on research under J.A. Douglas on the geology of the Channel Islands (D.Phil. 1931). In 1928 he was appointed Demonstrator in Geology at Leeds University and the following year was given a place on the Geological Survey of Great Britain mapping coal measures in Lancashire. He left the Survey in 1931. Mourant's interest in geology continued throughout his life and he continued to publish articles on geology alongside haematological and medical publications.</p> <p>Mourant returned to Jersey and in 1933 established the Jersey Chemical Pathology Laboratory, which he ran for five years. He then returned to London, intending to pursue a career as a psychoanalyst. As part of the necessary preparation he underwent psychoanalysis himself and in 1939 began medical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College, London. On the outbreak of war Mourant continued his medical training in London but when Jersey was occupied by the Germans in 1940 he lost contact with his family who remained on the island. During the period 1940-1945 Mourant played an active role in Channel Island exile groups</p> <p>Mourant graduated B.M. and B.Ch. in 1943 and held a number of House posts before his appointment in 1944 as Medical Officer in the National Blood Transfusion Service. Mourant had developed an interest in haematology during his medical training and during this period pursued research into blood serum. He discovered the antibody anti-e, thus helping to establish the threefactor theory of the Rhesus system, and the Lewis factor and he shared in the discovery of the Kell factor. With R.R. Race and R.R.A. Coombs he went on to develop the antiglobulin test.</p> <p>In 1945 Mourant took up a post as Medical Officer with the Galton Laboratory Serum Unit before in 1946 being appointed Director of the Medical Research Council's newly established Blood Group Reference Laboratory, based at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, London. Mourant held this post to 1965. The Laboratory received international recognition in 1952 when the World Health Organisation named it as their International Blood Group Reference Laboratory. Mourant's interests were increasingly anthropological and his work on human blood group distribution worldwide saw publication of two major books; in 1953 the pioneering work The Distribution of Human Blood Groups and other Biochemical Polymorphisms and in 1958 The ABO Blood Groups and Maps of World Distribution.</p> <p>In 1952 Mourant was appointed Honorary Advisor (de facto Director) of the newly established Nuffield Blood Group Centre. It was administered by and housed in the Royal Anthropological Institute, reporting to its Blood Group Committee. From 1952 to 1962 the Centre was funded by the Nuffield Foundation but the Medical Research Council then took over responsibility for financing the Centre, which changed its name to the Anthropological Blood Group Centre.</p> <p>In September 1965 Mourant retired from the Directorship of the Blood Group Reference Laboratory to become Head of the Medical Research Council's newly established Serological Population Genetics Laboratory (SPGL). The work of the SPGL was divided between two sections. The first was a testing laboratory similar to the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, working principally for the Human Adaptability Section of the International Biological Programme (IBP). The second section, undertaking statistical and bibliographical work, comprised the Anthropological Blood Group Centre that had been transferred to the SPGL. Much of its work was concentrated on the preparation of a second edition of The Distribution of the Human Blood Groups. The SPGL was based in premises rented by St Bartholomew's Hospital, London.</p> <p>The Medical Research Council announced that it was to close the SPGL in 1971. However, Mourant was anxious that the SPGL complete its work on The Distribution of the Human Blood Groups and other projects, including its work for the IBP. The Medical Research Council agreed to extend its support of the work on the distribution of human blood groups to 1973. Through assiduous fundraising Mourant found support for the other projects and was able to see them through to completion. The SPGL finally closed in 1976.</p> <p>Mourant retired to the family home in Jersey where he continued to publish on haematology and physical anthropology as well as geology. He died in 1994.</p> <p>For his contributions to haematology and blood transfusion services Mourant was accorded many honours and awards. These included the Oliver Memorial Award for services to Blood Transfusion in 1953, the Huxley Memorial Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1961, the Karl Landsteiner Memorial Award of the American Association of Blood Banks and the Osler Memorial Medal of Oxford University 1980. In 1985 he was made an Honorary Citizen of the city of Toulouse, through his association with the work of Jacques Ruffié, Director of the Centre d'Hémotypologie and Professor of Physical Anthropology at the College de France in Toulouse. Mourant was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1966.</p> <p>Mourant also received recognition for his geological work including the Marett Memorial Lecture at Exeter College Oxford in 1978 and the R.H. Worth Award of the Geological Society of London, 1982.</p></span>"

                  "administrativeBackground": "<span class=\"wrapper\"><p>Mourant was born on 11 April 1904 in Jersey. He was educated at Victoria College, Jersey before winning a King Charles I Scholarship to Exeter College Oxford where he read Chemistry. He graduated with a first class degree, taking crystallography as his special subject, and in 1926 went on research under J.A. Douglas on the geology of the Channel Islands (D.Phil. 1931). In 1928 he was appointed Demonstrator in Geology at Leeds University and the following year was given a place on the Geological Survey of Great Britain mapping coal measures in Lancashire. He left the Survey in 1931. Mourant's interest in geology continued throughout his life and he continued to publish articles on geology alongside haematological and medical publications.</p> <p>Mourant returned to Jersey and in 1933 established the Jersey Chemical Pathology Laboratory, which he ran for five years. He then returned to London, intending to pursue a career as a psychoanalyst. As part of the necessary preparation he underwent psychoanalysis himself and in 1939 began medical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College, London. On the outbreak of war Mourant continued his medical training in London but when Jersey was occupied by the Germans in 1940 he lost contact with his family who remained on the island. During the period 1940-1945 Mourant played an active role in Channel Island exile groups</p> <p>Mourant graduated B.M. and B.Ch. in 1943 and held a number of House posts before his appointment in 1944 as Medical Officer in the National Blood Transfusion Service. Mourant had developed an interest in haematology during his medical training and during this period pursued research into blood serum. He discovered the antibody anti-e, thus helping to establish the threefactor theory of the Rhesus system, and the Lewis factor and he shared in the discovery of the Kell factor. With R.R. Race and R.R.A. Coombs he went on to develop the antiglobulin test.</p> <p>In 1945 Mourant took up a post as Medical Officer with the Galton Laboratory Serum Unit before in 1946 being appointed Director of the Medical Research Council's newly established Blood Group Reference Laboratory, based at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, London. Mourant held this post to 1965. The Laboratory received international recognition in 1952 when the World Health Organisation named it as their International Blood Group Reference Laboratory. Mourant's interests were increasingly anthropological and his work on human blood group distribution worldwide saw publication of two major books; in 1953 the pioneering work The Distribution of Human Blood Groups and other Biochemical Polymorphisms and in 1958 The ABO Blood Groups and Maps of World Distribution.</p> <p>In 1952 Mourant was appointed Honorary Advisor (de facto Director) of the newly established Nuffield Blood Group Centre. It was administered by and housed in the Royal Anthropological Institute, reporting to its Blood Group Committee. From 1952 to 1962 the Centre was funded by the Nuffield Foundation but the Medical Research Council then took over responsibility for financing the Centre, which changed its name to the Anthropological Blood Group Centre.</p> <p>In September 1965 Mourant retired from the Directorship of the Blood Group Reference Laboratory to become Head of the Medical Research Council's newly established Serological Population Genetics Laboratory (SPGL). The work of the SPGL was divided between two sections. The first was a testing laboratory similar to the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, working principally for the Human Adaptability Section of the International Biological Programme (IBP). The second section, undertaking statistical and bibliographical work, comprised the Anthropological Blood Group Centre that had been transferred to the SPGL. Much of its work was concentrated on the preparation of a second edition of The Distribution of the Human Blood Groups. The SPGL was based in premises rented by St Bartholomew's Hospital, London.</p> <p>The Medical Research Council announced that it was to close the SPGL in 1971. However, Mourant was anxious that the SPGL complete its work on The Distribution of the Human Blood Groups and other projects, including its work for the IBP. The Medical Research Council agreed to extend its support of the work on the distribution of human blood groups to 1973. Through assiduous fundraising Mourant found support for the other projects and was able to see them through to completion. The SPGL finally closed in 1976.</p> <p>Mourant retired to the family home in Jersey where he continued to publish on haematology and physical anthropology as well as geology. He died in 1994.</p> <p>For his contributions to haematology and blood transfusion services Mourant was accorded many honours and awards. These included the Oliver Memorial Award for services to Blood Transfusion in 1953, the Huxley Memorial Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1961, the Karl Landsteiner Memorial Award of the American Association of Blood Banks and the Osler Memorial Medal of Oxford University 1980. In 1985 he was made an Honorary Citizen of the city of Toulouse, through his association with the work of Jacques Ruffié, Director of the Centre d'Hémotypologie and Professor of Physical Anthropology at the College de France in Toulouse. Mourant was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1966.</p> <p>Mourant also received recognition for his geological work including the Marett Memorial Lecture at Exeter College Oxford in 1978 and the R.H. Worth Award of the Geological Society of London, 1982.</p></span>",

                  "description": "<span class=\"wrapper\"><p>Section A, Biographical, includes the draft of Mourant's autobiography, Blood and Stones published after his death in 1995, together with the correspondence and papers Mourant assembled while writing it. There is also documentation of Mourant's education at Victoria College Jersey and at Exeter College Oxford. The latter includes notes on lectures 1922-ca 1926. Documentation of Mourant's career, honours and awards is patchy, although there is material relating to his search for employment in the early 1930s. There are pocket diaries spanning 1915-1982, with a fairly continuous sequence 1922-1961. The section includes extensive family and personal correspondence, much of which dates from or relates to the German occupation of Jersey or shortly thereafter. Mourant's other documented interests include his membership of the Methodist Church and his political affiliations, the League of Nations Union in particular.</p> <p>Section B, Early career, is very slight. It is chiefly documentation of Mourant's period with the Geological Survey 1929-1931.</p> <p>Section C, Blood Group Reference Laboratory and Blood Group Centre, is not extensive. It brings together miscellaneous material relating to Mourant's service with the Medical Research Council's Blood Group Reference Laboratory based at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine and the Nuffield (later Anthropological) Blood Group Centre at the Royal Anthropological Institute, London.</p> <p>Section D, Serological Population Genetics Laboratory, is uneven in its coverage. Although there is some documentation of the foundation of the laboratory 1964-1965 and of its staff, it consists chiefly of correspondence and papers relating to Mourant's largely successful efforts to find continued funding for the Laboratory 1969-1977. Mourant approached a number of bodies, including the European Research Office of the US Army, the Nuffield Foundation, the Wolfson Foundation and the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>Section E, Haematological research, though not extensive, covers Mourant's work in a number of important areas from research on blood serum in the mid-1940s to the mapping of blood groups in the 1960s and 1970s. There are early research notes, correspondence and papers relating to student and other expeditions undertaking blood group and physical anthropology research, and some Medical Research Council material assembled by Mourant relating to projects in which he had an interest. The largest component of the section, however, is maps and data produced during preparation of the second edition of The Distribution of the Human Blood Groups.</p> <p>Section F, Publications, presents a chronological sequence of drafts and correspondence relating to Mourant's publications 1929-1991 and undated, with extensive material relating to editions of The Distribution of the Human Blood Groups and to The Genetics of the Jews (1978). There is also editorial correspondence relating to publishers and journals, chiefly invitations to review books or referee papers, and an incomplete set of offprints. Following Mourant's own practice, no attempt has been made to separate Mourant's biological and anthropological publications from his geological and archaeological ones. Where applicable reference is made to the list of Mourant's publications from his autobiography (A.1) in the form Bibliog, no... However, not all of Mourant's published work was listed in the bibliography.</p> <p>Section G, Lectures and broadcasts, presents correspondence and papers relating to some of Mourant's public and invitation lectures and broadcasts. The largest component of the section is Mourant's lectures on blood groups given at the College de France, Toulouse, 1978-1979. Not all of Mourant's lecturing is represented in this section, reference should also be made to section H. There is a little correspondence relating to broadcasts and two lectures and broadcasts by others.</p> <p>Section H, Societies and organisations, is not extensive, and is confined to brief documentation of only a few of the societies and organisations with which Mourant was associated. It includes professional and geological bodies as well as haematological, biological and medical organisations.</p> <p>Section J, Visits and conferences, covers the period 1960-1987. The visit best documented is that to North America in 1980. The section is not comprehensive and there is also considerable documentation of Mourant's visits and conferences in the papers he assembled in the course of preparing his autobiography (see NCUACS 85/6/99/A.16-NCUACS 85/6/99/A.47) and in section G, Lectures and broadcasts.</p> <p>Section K, Correspondence, is the largest in the collection. Its complexity reflects Mourant's organisation of the material. The bulk of it was found in three main series: 'Foreign 1965-1977', 'Biological' and 'Geological', together with a fragment of a fourth series 'Home 1965-1977'. In addition to the material preserved in these four series, Mourant kept separate files for some correspondents and some correspondence was found loose. This additional correspondence is presented in three artificial series titled 'Other biological correspondence', 'Other geological correspondence' and 'References and recommendations'. As Mourant's arrangement has been retained correspondents can appear in two or more series without any distinction in terms of subject or date. Principal correspondents include C.C. Blackwell, B. Bonn, O.J. Brendemoen, V.A. Clarke, L.L. Cavalli-Sforza, A. W. Eriksson, T.J. Greenwalt, J.K. Moor-Jankowski, T. Jenkins, W.S. Pollitzer, D.F. Roberts, J. Ruffí, D. Tills and J.S. Weiner.</p></span>",

Additional explanatory notes, Information and cross-references are appended where appropriate to the separate sections, sub-sections and individual entries in the body of the catalogue. The following paragraphs are intended only to draw attention to items of particular interest.</p> <p>Section A (Biographical and autobiographical), though not extensive, covers in varying detail the principal stages of Phillips's career from schooldays onward: It includes many offers of appointments not otherwise documented as well as the known public honours he received. It also includes several autobiographical accounts prepared by Phillips at various dates; similar occasional accounts occur elsewhere in the collection and attention is drawn to them in the catalogue entries.</p> <p>Section B (Diaries and notebooks) is of interest for a series of notebooks which constitute a general journal of considerable value in several regards. The books, covering the years 1960-90 (with an unexplained gap from 1976 to 1984), contain Phillips's notes on scientific research projects and progress, Interviews and discussions with colleagues, staff and visitors in the laboratory, salaries, funding and laboratory requirements, aides-memoire on telephone conversations or letters received, drafts for lectures or conference papers, comments on theses or papers sent for comment, notes taken at lectures, seminars or conferences, and in the later years notes of ABRC or Research Council meetings and discussions on science policy.</p> <p>Section C (Research notebooks and notes) provides records, some by collaborators and not always in full detail, for all stages of Phillips's career from his post-doctoral appointment in 1951 at the National Research Laboratories Ottawa. The material is presented by topic. These include the development at the Royal Institution London (with U.W. Arndt) of the semi-automatic and later of the linear diffractometer, and collaborative work with J.C. Kendrew (later Sir John) and his team at Cambridge on the structure of myoglobin. Phillips's most widely known achievement, the structure of lysozyme and its mechanism of action, on which he continued to work for most of his career, is documented here by his detailed records of the co-ordinates. Later projects at Oxford such as the successful analysis of triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) are also documented.</p> <p>However, not all Phillips's research career is fully covered by the surviving material in this collection. His activity as a founder member and later chairman of the Oxford Enzyme Group (OEG) can be found in the collection of the OEG papers held in the Bodleian Library, and a detailed record of all stages of the myoglobin project is contained in the manuscript collection of Sir John Kendrew also held in the Bodleian Library.</p> <p>Section D (The Royal Institution) is relatively short, but contains records not only of the important decade in Phillips's career from his appointment as a Research Fellow in 1956 by W.L. Bragg until his appointment at Oxford in 1966, but also of his continuing involvement with the Institution as Manager, member of Council, lecturer and active participant in its affairs including the award of its Actonian Prize in 1991. For the early period the material is mainly correspondence, on the equipment and research projects referred to in relation to Section C, and on the events surrounding the successful lysozyme analysis. Several of Phillips's long-term colleagues at the Institution accompanied him to Oxford, in particular C.C.F. Blake, A.C.T. North and L.N. Johnson.</p> <p>The Director of the Royal Institution throughout Phillips's decade there was W.L. Bragg (Sir Lawrence Bragg). Their mutual affectionate regard can be seen both in this Section and passim elsewhere in the collection.</p> <p>Section E (Oxford) shows Phillips moving to a wider stage. As the University's first Professor of Molecular Biophysics from 1966 he had the responsibility of setting up and running a new department and of establishing the subject as an integral part of Oxford science. There were difficulties to be overcome both before and after the move from London, notably over the status and salaries of the team-members hitherto paid by the Medical Research Council, delays over the promised new Zoology Department building in which the Laboratory was to be housed, and the assurance of continued funding from MRC and other outside bodies for powerful computing capacity and for specific research projects. The Chair also carried with it the obligation to participate in the general administation of the University through faculty and inter-faculty boards, the organisation of syllabuses, teaching and advanced study, appointments and elections to posts in the Laboratory and in the University at large. All these activites are well documented. Phillips's success can be gauged in part from the very large number of requests to work, visit, conduct collaborative projects or consult with him and his colleagues. Many of the documents relating to these matters bear annotations, comments or information from the Laboratory team, since Phillips continued there the practice he had begun on a more limited scale at the Royal Institution of circulating all but personal communications to senior laboratory members, to keep them fully informed of events and to solicit their advice or views.</p> <p>Although Phillips's Chair carried with it a Fellowship of Corpus Christi College, he did not play a particularly active part in college life, choosing rather to give his time and energy to the scientific world at Oxford and outside.</p> <p>Section F (Publications) includes some drafts and material for Phillips's own scientific papers, though fewer than might be expected. During his most active research period he was a reluctant writer and rarely kept documentation once a paper was published. His major papers on lysozyme are, however, well documented, especially his 1966 article in Scientific American which was illustrated by hand-drawn diagrams specially commissioned from the artist Irving Geis. This was a rare solution to the recurring problem of presenting three-dimensional results on the printed page, which in the 1960s and 1970s usually Involved red-green diagrams and filter spectacles for the reader.</p> <p>Also of interest is the extensive material assembled by Phillips for his Memoir of W.L. Bragg written for the Royal Society and published in 1979.</p> <p>Phillips found time to act as referee or editorial consultant to many publishing houses though he was obliged to decline very many requests to undertake such work. Specialist journals with which he had long connections as contributor, editor or consultant include Acta Crystallographica, Biochemistry, EMBO Journal and Journal of Molecular Biology. The principal publishing houses with which he was involved were IRL Press, Medical and Technical Publishing Company and Oxford University Press. His editorial and advisory work for the Royal Society is documented in Section L.</p> <p>Section G (Conferences, visits, lectures) is the most extensive in the collection, reflecting Phillips's close involvement in the diffusion of scientific information and his success therein. The time-span covered is 1957-93, including an addendum for items received at a late date. The introduction to Section G describes in more detail the content of the material and its interest as witness to the evolution of Phillips's research, the range of audience addressed, and his gifts as a refreshing speaker on technical and, later, science policy topics.</p> <p>Section H (Radio, television, films) is very short and not a full record of Phillips's activity in these fields. It does, however, document his work for the Open University, Including a prize-winning film on lysozyme.</p> <p>Section J (UK societies, organisations, consultancies) records, in varying detail, Phillips's involvement with over a score of such organisations. Attention is drawn in particular to the material on the British Crystallographic Association which includes many of the founding and fund-raising early papers of the Association, the CIBA Foundation which was one of Phillips's major commitments (he served on the Council of the Foundation for sixteen years), and Celltech, an enterprise set up to exploit discoveries in biotechnology.</p> <p>Section K (International societies, organisations, consultancies), while containing similar material concerning overseas organisations, includes a higher proportion of work on advisory boards or scientific councils of laboratories and institutions relating to their research programmes. Examples are the Basle University Biozentrum, the Committee for the European Development of Science and Technology (CODEST), the Harvard-Monsanto Research Agreement (an experiment in collaborative research between industry and academia), the 'Single-crystal intensity measurement programme' and other affairs of the International Union of Crystallography, the International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB), the Max-Planck institute of Biochemistry Scientific Council, and the Weizmann Institute Israel.</p> <p>Section L (The Royal Society) provides useful documentation of Phillips's long association with the Society, notably his service as Biological Secretary 1976-83. It includes work on various committees, sometimes as chairman, overseas visits and delegations, editorial and advisory work for the Society's publications, material on the organisation of the Fellowship and its Sectional committees, elections and awards, and general correspondence of the Society's affairs.</p> <p>Section M (Science Research Council) is short, relating mainly to the Cray Computer and the Daresbury Laboratory.</p> <p>Section N (Medical Research Council) is an extensive record of Phillips's service as a Council member 1974-78 and a Royal Society 'Attending Assessor' 1976-83. The introduction to the Section outlines more fully his wide-ranging work for the Council as Chairman of the Cell Board and member of many committees, working parties and delegations such as those set up consider the Cambridge Laboratory of Molecular Biology, the European Laboratory of Molecular Biology (EMBL) and the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR).</p> <p>Section O (Advisory Board for the Research Councils) (ABRC) records Phillips's career as government adviser, from his appointment as part-time Chairman of ABRC in January 1983 through his appointment as full-time Chairman from April 1990 (when he resigned his Oxford Chair) to the period following the General Election of May 1992. Immediately after the election, changes were announced in government organisation for education and science which meant that responsibility for science and technology was transferred from the Department of Education and Science (to whose Secretaries of State Phillips had hitherto addressed the ABRC's advice) to the newly-created Office of Science and Technology under the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Phillips's extended period of service as ABRC Chairman ended in September 1993, but he remained as acting Director-General of the Research Councils until December 1993.</p> <p>Section P (Correspondence) is extensive. Always conducted in easy and friendly terms, it is primarily concerned with projects in protein research. It includes useful exchanges with colleagues on myoglobin and lysozyme. There is also further material relating to W.L. Bragg.</p> <p>Section R (References and recommendations) is also extensive and demonstrates the international respect in which Phillips was held by the many requests for advice or evaluation on appointments from universities and institutions worldwide. There is also a very large number of research grant assessments.</p> <p>Conditions of restricted access apply to this and to other Sections of the collection.Visits</p> <p>L.31-L.33A General correspondence</p> <p>L.34-L.38 Organisation of the Fellowhip</p> <p>L.39-L.62 Elections, appointments, awards</p> <p>SECTION M SCIENCE RESEARCH COUNCIL/SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL (SRC/SERC) M.1-M.13</p> <p>SECTION N MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (MRC) N.1-N.64</p> <p>N.1 Council correspondence</p> <p>N.2-N.21 Boards and committees</p> <p>N.22-N.47 Sub-committees, review groups, working parties</p> <p>N.48-N.52 Visits to MRC laboratories and units</p> <p>N.53-N.64 Conferences and discussion meetings</p> <p>SECTION O ADVISORY BOARD FOR THE RESEARCH COUNCILS (ABRC) O.1-O.261</p> <p>O.1-O.5 Appointments and personal</p> <p>O.6-O.14 Structure and Membership</p> <p>O.15-O.49 Research councils</p> <p>O.50-O.58 UK scientific and academic Institutions</p> <p>O.59-O.68 UK science policy institutions and pressure groups</p> <p>O.69-O.79 Parliamentary select committees</p> <p>O.80-O.97 Government departments</p> <p>O.98-O.105 Science policy studies</p> <p>O.106-O.120 Reports and working parties</p> <p>O.121-O.123 Serminars and conferences</p> <p>O.124-O.126 Miscellaneous committees and sub-committees</p> <p>O.127-O.141 International relations and collaboration</p> <p>O.142-O.175 Visits and engagements</p> <p>O.176-O.203 ABRC submissions and advice</p> <p>O.204-O.219 1993 White Paper and boundary study</p> <p>O.220-O.234 Memoranda and meetings 1982-93</p> <p>O.235-O.247 General correspondence 1983-93</p> <p>O.248-O.261 Addendum</p> <p>SECTION P CORRESPONDENCE P.1-P.304</p> <p>P.1-P.292 Scientific and general correspondence</p> <p>P.293-P.296 Shorter scientific correspondence</p> <p>P.297-P.304 Unindexed correspondence</p> <p>SECTION R REFERENCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS R.1-R.159</p> <p>R.1-R.3 Theses and higher degrees</p> <p>R.4-R.6 University external examining</p> <p>R.7-R.66 University appointments</p> <p>R.67, R.68 Agricultural Research Council/ Agricultural and Food Research Council</p> <p>R.69-R.83 Medical Research Council</p> <p>R.84-R.104 Science Research Council/ Science and Engineering Research Council</p> <p>R.105-R.125 UK foundations and grant-giving institutions</p> <p>R.126-R.152 Overseas foundations and grant-giving Institutions</p> <p>R.153-R.155 Awards, prizes, honours</p> <p>R.156-R.159 Personal</p> <p>The material is presented as shown in the List of Contents.

Like all such large-scale cataloguing projects it has had a long gestation. Indeed it may almost be said to have had its origins in the earliest days of the NCUACS's Oxford-based predecessor organisation. Sir David has taken an active interest in the scientific archives project since its inception in 1973 and Mrs Jeannine Alton who has now catalogued the Phillips papers for the NCUACS was in charge of the archives work in Oxford from 1973 until the transfer of operations to the University of Bath in 1987. The more immediate impetus for the Phillips cataloguing project, however, was Sir David's resignation in 1990 from his Professorship of Molecular Biophysics at Oxford University to assume the full-time Chairmanship of the Advisory Board for the Research Councils in London. The imminence of his departure from Oxford led to discussions with Sir David about the very substantial archive in his Oxford laboratory, a detailed archival assessment of their quantity, nature and importance for a wide range of aspects of the history of science, and the development of a funding proposal for submission to the Leverhulme Trust. We were very fortunate to secure funding from the Trust for two years with an extension for a third year as the science policy interest of Phillips's career took on a greater archival importance than had originally been anticipated. Sir David has been supportive throughout with advice and encouragement and Mrs Alton's expertise and experience has magnificently met the challenge of difficult technical material, the complexity of UK and international science organisation and the piecemeal delivery of papers over an extended period.</p> <p>The NCUACS would like to take this opportunity to record our gratitude to the Director of the Leverhulme Trust, Sir Rex Richards, and the Leverhulme Trustees for their support of the scientific archives work since the transfer of operations to Bath in 1987. This has taken the form of three major cataloguing projects: the papers of Sir John Kendrew (1987-1989), Sir David Phillips (1991-1994) and Professor Dorothy Hodgkin OM (1992-1994). The three collections are deposited in the Bodleian Library, Oxford where they form an indispensable corpus of material for the history of twentieth-century British science.</p> <p>Peter Harper</p> <p>Archivist, NCUACS</p> <p>February 1994</p> <p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</p> <p>Thanks are due primarily to Sir David Phillips for initially allowing his papers to go forward for cataloguing and for making additional material available on a continuing basis. He has been generous with his time and attention for consultation, and, in addition to the autobiographical account quoted above, has made invaluable comments on the catalogue drafts throughout the lengthy process of compilation. Lady Phillips has also contributed much valued information and advice.</p> <p>Mrs Pam Batchelor, Phillips's former secretary at Oxford, was very helpful in overseeing and advising on the transfer of material from the laboratory.</p> <p>Members of the NCUACS, Peter Harper and Timothy E.

The original is included at A.74.</p> <p>Autobiographical sketch, February 1994.</p> <p>I was born on 7 March 1924 in Ellesmere, Shropshire, a small country town on the border between England and Wales. My father, Charles Harry Phillips, was a Master Tailor and a Methodist local preacher. My mother, Edith Harriet Phillips, was the daughter of Samuel Finney, one-time Secretary of the Midland Miners' Federation and Member of Parliament 1916-22: she was a London-trained midwife, the organist at Ellesmere Methodist Church and long a member of the Ellesmere Urban District Council. My unusual middle name is the maiden surname of my mother's great grandmother and it is a reminder of the family myth that we are related in some way to the Pilgrim Father, James Chilton.</p> <p>A key influence on my development came from my father, who was a very academically-inclined, thoughtful person who attempted to join the Wesleyan Methodist Ministry but failed, he always said, because his written sermon was not good enough. His extempore sermons, which he constructed in his head while he was sewing, were certainly powerful enough and I have sometimes wondered whether this background affected my own preference for speaking from rudimentary notes, or none at all.</p> <p>But the more formal academic influence came from my mother's side of the family. Her father was also a Methodist local preacher, this time Primitive Methodist, who taught himself New Testament Greek and his youngest daughter, my aunt Kathleen, went to Manchester University to read English. She married D.A.R. Clark, an engineering graduate of Manchester Tech (UMIST as it now is) who became a Technical College teacher, rising to be Principal of Middlesborough and then Nottingham Technical Colleges.</p> <p>These members of the family were important influences but even more important were my mother's cousins, J.F. and A.H. Bagnall. These were the sons of my grandmother's brother Joe, who worked as a Post Office clerk in Manchester and was again a Primitive Methodist local preacher. Jack and Herbert both went to Manchester Grammar School. Jack went on to read engineering at Manchester Tech while Herbert won a scholarship at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, read Greats and ended as classics master at Exeter School. Of the two Jack was the Influential figure. He went to work in India in the late twenties and used to come home on leave every three years. These were among the most memorable events in my childhood. This larger-than-life figure would descend on Ellesmere in a large car and waft us about the countryside exuding a great air of confidence and full of stories about the hardly dreamed of world out there. It was he, I believe, who instilled in me the thought that anything was possible.</p> <p>The Bagnalls seemed the dominant family in my early life. In addition to my grandmother, Mary Ellen, and her brother Joe there were three other brothers, Ted, Sam and Will, all local preachers, who had escaped from Ellesmere and lived respectively, when I first remember them, in Blandford Forum, Birmingham and Stroud. Ted and Will were both Liberal Party election agents and Sam worked, I believe, for the Shropshire Union Canal Company. His only son, Howard, read chemistry at Birmingham University and became City Analyst of Birmingham - another role model, though not as charismatic as his cousin Jack.</p> <p>My formal education was at the Church of England infants and elementary schools in Ellesmere and at the High School for Boys at Oswestry, some eight miles away on the Cambrian Railway. In 1942 I took Higher School Certificate in Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics, with subsidiary French and was awarded a State Bursary to study Physics, Mathematics and Radio Communications at University College, Cardiff, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Wales, where I took a war-time degree in June 1944. I then joined the Royal Navy for training as a Radar Officer, being posted to H.M.S. Illustrious in the Spring of 1945.</p> <p>After demobilisation in February 1947, I returned to Cardiff where I was awarded First-Class Honours in Physics in 1948 and began research in X-ray crystallography under the supervision of A.J.C.Wilson. As a graduate student I analysed the structures of ephedrine and one of the polymorphic forms of acridine and I played a part in developing the statistical tests for crystal symmetry that were devised in this period out of Wilson's work on the probability distribution of X-ray intensities.</p> <p>After taking my PhD in 1951, I joined the National Research Laboratories, Ottawa, Canada, as a Post-doctoral Fellow in the Crystallography Laboratory led by W.H. Barnes. First as a Post-doctoral Fellow (1951-53) and then as a member of the Research Staff (1953-55), I continued studies of the three-dimensional structures of relatively small molecules, extending the analyses to involve the use of three-dimensional data, developing the method of photographic data collection and introducing the use in Ottawa of digital computers - in collaboration with F.R. Ahmed, whom I helped to recruit.</p> <p>In 1955, on the suggestion of Dorothy Hodgkin, I was invited by W.L. Bragg to join the Research Staff of the Royal Institution, London, where Bragg was building up a team to work on protein crystals. On leaving Cambridge in 1954, Bragg had hoped to attract members of the Medical Research Council Research Unit at the Cavendish Laboratory (M.F. Perutz and J.C. Kendrew) to move to the Royal Institution with him, but they preferred to remain in Cambridge where their studies of haemoglobin and myoglobin had begun to develop well. They agreed to help Bragg, however, by collaborating with his new team in London. Consequently, on moving to the Royal Institution, I began to collaborate with J.C. Kendrew in his studies of myoglobin while at the same time collaborating with U.W. Arndt on the development of X-ray diffractometers. I used a semi-automatic four-circle diffractometer to measure some of the X-ray data that were used in the low-resolution analysis of the structure of sperm-whale myoglobin that was completed in 1958, and then went on to devise (with Arndt) an automatic diffractometer that incorporated an analogue computer - the Linear Diffractometer - while, at the same time, collaborating with Kendrew in extending the myoglobin analysis to high resolution. In this stage of the myoglobin work, the crystals were prepared at the Royal Institution (by V.C. Shore) and they were photographed partly in London and partly in Cambridge. The photographs were densitometered in the two centres and the final sets of data were assembled in Cambridge. The 2Å-resolution map of myoglobin - the first protein structure to be determined - was calculated in the autumn of 1959 and published in 1960.</p> <p>The Linear Diffractometer was developed commercially by Hilger &amp; Watts Ltd and was used in a number of subsequent crystallographic studies: C.C.F. Blake and I used the laboratory prototype, constructed by T.H. Faulkner in the Royal Institution workshop, to collect data to 1.4Å resolution for sperm-whale myoglobin. These data were used in a preliminary refinement of the structure at Cambridge in the period 1962-64, though the problem at this stage was beyond the power of current computers.</p> <p>It was in this period, in 1960, that I married Diana Kathleen Hutchinson, who was Bragg's secretary, and we had our only child Sarah Anne, born in 1962.</p> <p>In 1960, Roberto Poljak came to the Royal Institution as a post-doctoral worker and suggested that work on hen egg-white lysozyme might be successful-a proposal based upon his preliminary search for suitable heavy-atom derivatives at MIT under the guidance of Howard Dintzis, a myoglobin veteran. At this stage, I turned my attention to lysozyme and - with Bragg's encouragement - focused the greater part of the Royal Institution effort on the determination of its structure. In 1962 a promising low-resolution (6A) map of the enzyme was obtained - whereupon Poljak left the Royal Institution to work on genetics at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. At the Royal Institution, in collaboration particularly with A.C.T. North, C.C.F. Blake and V.R. Sarma, I concentrated on extending the analysis to high (2A) resolution and, at the same time, I initiated crystallographic studies of complexes between the enzyme and competitive inhibitors related to its substrate. These studies were carried out in collaboration with my research student, Louise N. Johnson.</p> <p>By the use of the Linear Diffractometer, now fitted with three detectors, and an in-house Elliott 803 computer provided by the Medical Research Council, these studies led to the calculation of a readily-interpretable electron-density map of the enzyme early in 1965 and the proposal of its mechanism of action about a year later.</p> <p>During this period of excitement arrangements were also being made for Bragg's retirement aged 75 and, as the result of proposals by Dorothy Hodgkin, J.W.S. Pringle and H.A. Krebs, I was offered a Professorship of Molecular Biophysics at Oxford. With the active support of the Medical Research Council, led by Sir H. Himsworth, I was able to take with me the greater part of the research group at the Royal Institution, with lecturerships for North and Blake, and to set up a new Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics. The laboratory was associated with the Department of Zoology, headed by Pringle, and plans were agreed to house it in the new Zoology building that was then being designed.</p> <p>We moved to Oxford in September 1966, being housed initially in the Old Physiology Building. In addition to the group from the Royal Institution I also recruited to University Lecturerships Drs A. Miller and R.E. Offord from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. Miller worked on fibrous proteins and muscle while Offord was a protein chemist so that, with North and Blake providing single-crystal expertise and with backgrounds, respectively, in physics and chemistry, we formed a reasonably well-balanced group to help extend studies of protein structure and function in Oxford. Louise Johnson rejoined us as a Departmental Demonstrator in 1967, after a post-doctoral year at Yale.</p> <p>In Oxford, I envisaged the Laboratory as a group of independent but closely interacting research teams led by the University Lecturers and myself. In particular, I attached great importance to having a lively protein chemistry group within the laboratory to interact with the structure analysts at all stages of their work from the identification of problems for research to the consideration of results and how best they might be developed in a biological context. Three of the four original University lecturers (North, Offord and Miller) left over the years and were replaced by L.N. Johnson, A.R. Rees and D.I. Stuart, of whom Rees also left for a Professorship elsewhere towards the end of my period in Oxford.</p> <p>Studies of lysozyme were continued, partly to develop new methods, but a major part of the effort, especially in the early years, was aimed at at detailed understanding of the enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. My part in this was the determination of the structure of triose-phosphate Isomerase together with substrate and inhibitor binding studies that revealed the structural features underlying the catalytic mechanism. This research programme also involved scientists in other Departments in Oxford who collaborated as members of the Oxford Enzyme Group of which I was one of the founders. The group was chaired initially by Sir Rex Richards and, under his leadership, concentrated on the development of NMR spectroscopy as applied to biological problems in parallel with the continuing development of X-ray crystallography - especially in the analysis of protein mobility. I became Chairman of the Group in 1984.</p> <p>Also in collaboration with members of the Enzyme Group, and encouraged by Rodney Porter and Edward Abraham, in the 1980s I concentrated more on studies of immunoglobulins and B-lactamases and, through discussions with F. Brown, I stimulated David Stuart's successful analysis of the structure of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus.</p> <p>In 1974 I was appointed a member of the Medical Research Council and the founder Chairman of the Cell Biology &amp; Disorders Board, one of the subsidiary Boards that was set up in a general reorganisation of the Council's operating structure in that year. I served as Board Chairman until 1976, during which time the most significant events were, probably, the continuing discussions with the Departments of Health (of England and Scotland) regarding the transfer of funds from the MRC to the Departments following the Rothschild Report of 1972, and the review of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the time of M.F. Perutz's formal retirement. This review led to the Phillips Report which proposed some re-balancing of the programme of work at LMB but successfully headed off those who were then criticising what they saw as the Council's over emphasis on Molecular Biology. I continued as a member of the MRC until 1978 and was subsequently the Royal Society assessor on the Council until 1983.</p> <p>In 1976 I was elected Biological Secretary and vice-president of the Royal Society and served in those capacities until 1983. During this time I played a part in abolishing the Society's longstanding small-grants scheme and replacing it with a scheme for the support of University Research Fellows which was designed to ensure the long-term support of highly-talented young scientists in advance of their obtaining academic appointments. Another activity was the preparation of evidence for Parliamentary Select Committees on a variety of subjects one of which, on the provision of scientific advice to government, may have had an influence on my next appointment. In this report the Society criticised the Advisory Board for the Research Councils and recommended that the Board should be reconstituted with a part-time chairman able to give two days a week to the task.</p> <p>In January 1983 I was appointed Chairman of the Advisory Board for the Research Councils (ABRC) on the terms proposed by the Royal Society report, for a four-year term of office. The appointment also carried with it ex-officio membership of the Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development (ACARD) and, subsequently, of its successor body the Advisory Council on Science &amp; Technology (ACOST). This continued until mid-1993. I was also involved from time to time in the discussions of Official Committees, whose duties are to prepare papers for meetings of Cabinet Committees.</p> <p>At this time, the ABRC was responsible for advising the Secretary of State for Education and Science on the size of the science budget, which was determined annually as a part of the Public Expenditure round, and how the funds that were made available should be distributed among the five Research Councils, the Royal Society, the Fellowship of Engineering and the Natural History Museum. In addition, the Board conducted or commissioned studies on various aspects of science policy and the state of the science base that were designed to help in the formulation of sound advice.</p> <p>For example, during my first term of office the Board published studies of 'Future Facilities for Advanced Research Computing'; 'High Energy Particle Physics in the United Kingdom'; the 'Evaluation of national performance in basic research'; 'Private Sector Funding of Scientific Research'; an 'International Comparison of Government Funding of Academic and Academically Related Research'; and 'Contract Researchers in Universities'. All of these promoted useful debate on topics that remained important throughout my chairmanship.</p> <p>In 1986 I agreed to serve as chairman for a second four year term and, apart from the regular business of the Board in relation to the size and distribution of the Science Budget, this period was dominated by the preparation and publication of two reports. The first of these, entitled 'A Strategy for the Science Base' (1987) addressed fundamental issues in the organisation of university research and provoked a great deal of debate. In particular, the proposition that some universities should expect to be engaged in substantial research activity across the range of fields, while others were engaged in substantial world class research in particular fields and a third group were engaged in the scholarship and research necessary to support and develop teaching, was greeted with outrage. Nevertheless, under the influence of the Research Selectivity Exercise, initiated by the University Grants Committee (UGC) in 1985 and repeated twice since then by the University Funding Council (UFC), together with the abolition of the binary line, which admitted former Polytechnics to University status, a differentiation of universities remarkably like that proposed by the ABRC has emerged. Another major recommendation of the report, that the allocation of responsibilities between Research Councils and Funding Councils within the dual support of university research should be shifted towards the Research Councils, has been accepted by government and implemented; while a further proposal, that interdisciplinary research should be promoted by the establishment of interdisciplinary research centres (IRCs), has also been implemented to a certain extent. Numbers of the other proposals, for example that the Research Councils should develop more explicit policies for the management of research manpower in universities, re-emerged in the White Paper of 1993.</p> <p>The second major report in this period arose from concern about the way in which support for biology was distributed across the Research Councils. Under the chairmanship of Mr J.R.S. Morris, a study group appointed to address this problem produced a wide-ranging report that proposed a radical reform of the Research Council system. They proposed that a single Research Council should be set up with operating divisions that would cover the responsibilities of the existing Research Councils distributed rather differently so that, for example, the responsibility for nonmedical biology would be concentrated in a single division. According to these proposals, the ABRC was to be replaced by the Council of the single research council with a part-time non-executive chairman and a full-time chief executive.</p> <p>In the autumn of 1989, the ABRC discussed this report and decided not to recommend its acceptance to ministers. However, they set up a small working party, comprising the heads of the Research Councils and two independent members of the Board under my chairmanship, to propose more modest changes to the existing system. Out of this process came proposals that the ABRC should be reconstituted under a full-time chairman and with a slimmed-down membership comprising the executive heads of the five Research Councils, six independent - or non-executive - members drawn from industry and academe, and two assessors - the Chief Scientific Advisor to the government and the Deputy Secretary with responsibility for the science base in the Department of Education &amp; Science. Specifically, the Chief Scientists from other government departments were to be removed from membership though they were to be guaranteed access to the Board for discussion of issues that particularly affected their departments.</p> <p>These proposals were accepted by government and the Board was reconstituted from 1 April 1990. I accepted an invitation to be the first full-time chairman for a three-year period.</p> <p>This reorganisation led to my resignation from my professorship in Oxford, a year earlier than I had expected, and my wife and I moved to London in July 1990. Meanwhile, the University had formally considered the future need for a Professorship of Molecular Biophysics and had agreed that the post should continue. Thanks to the generosity of Sir Edward Abraham, the Professorship was supported by an endowment and, at Sir Edward's suggestion, it was named the David Phillips Professorship of Molecular Biophysics. Shortly after my departure from Oxford, Dr Louise N. Johnson was appointed to the Chair.</p> <p>After the reconstitution of the ABRC the major benefits arose from changes in procedure that led the heads of Research Councils to play a fuller part in the Board's business and underlined more clearly than before the responsibilities of the Research Councils themselves to support the work of highest priority in their areas of interest instead of looking to government to provide extra resources to cover new scientific opportunities of high priority. This regime continued through the Public Expenditure rounds of 1990 and 1991 alongside a continuing programme of studies, now organised under the aegis of sub-committees of the Board. These included sub-committees of Manpower, Biotechnology, Super-computing and Science Policy, all of which were supported by members of the ABRC Secretariat and generated important reports and discussion papers. In addition, an Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change (IACGEC) was set up under my chairmanship to co-ordinate the thinking of funding agencies, including the Research Councils, the Met Office, the British National Space Centre, and other government departments - who were represented by the Department of the Environment - on this important and politically prominent issue.</p> <p>After the General Election of April 1992, the Prime Minister unexpectedly announced a reorganisation of the support for science and technology within government. Responsibility for the Science Budget - but not the Funding Council support for University research - was transferred from the DES to a new Office of Science &amp; Technology within the Office of Public Service &amp; Science under the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr William Waldegrave. The head of the OST was the Chief Science Advisor, Professor W.D.P. Stewart.</p> <p>Under these new arrangements, the Board continued to operate essentially as before but now submitting its advice on the Science Budget to the Chancellor of the Duchy. Almost immediately, however, the Chancellor announced his intention of publishing a White Paper on Science &amp; Technology in 1993 and the Board spent most of the summer and autumn of 1992 preparing its advice on the nature of this White Paper. This drew quite heavily on the 1987 Strategy Advice, the debates of 1989, which had led to the reconstitution of the Board, and the experience of the reconstituted Board. It was submitted on 30 October 1992 and proposed a revision of the Research Council system closely similar to that proposed in the Morris report.</p> <p>At about this time, in view of the perceived need to improve co-ordination between the Funding Council and Research Council components of the science base, I was appointed a member of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and an observer on the Welsh Higher Education Funding Council (HEFCW). These developments took place partly as a result of ABRC initiatives in holding meetings with Funding Council officials in Edinburgh and in Cardiff.</p> <p>ACOST, of which I was also a member, produced advice in parallel with that of the ABRC with which the ABRC did not agree. It envisaged, for example, a separate Research Council for the advancement of scientific knowledge alongside Councils for mission orientated research. The two sets of advice were presented by the chairman of ACOST and myself to a meeting of OST ministers and senior staff on 3 November 1992 and this was the beginning of a long process of debate and drafting within the OST and government generally that led, on 26 May 1993, to the publication of the White Paper.</p> <p>Recognising that the functions of the ABRC would have to continue until any changes announced in the White Paper could be put into effect, Mr Waldegrave asked me first to extend my chairmanship until 30 September 1993 and then until 31 December 1993 at which time, under the terms of the White Paper, the ABRC was to be abolished and its chairman replaced by a Director General of Research Councils.</p> <p>During the period from the publication of the White Paper to the end of the year, I played the part of Acting DGRC and, in particular, conducted an urgent study of the reallocation of resources to the new Research Councils, whose boundaries and missions were closely defined in the White Paper. My advice was accepted by the Chancellor at the end of July and I spent the remainder of the year helping to implement further White Paper decisions and playing a part in the appointment of non-executive chairman and chief executives for the new Research Councils. I retired on 31 December 1993 and Sir John Cadogan took over as DGRC.</p> <p>In retirement, I remain a non-executive director of Celltech, a position I have occupied since 1982; a Trustee of the Wolfson Foundation (first appointed in 1988); an editor of the Journal Biochemistry; a member of the Davy-Faraday Laboratory Committee of the Royal Institution; and non-executive chairman of Finsbury Communications, the company founded by my son-in-law, Dr Paul Matthewson. Furthermore, I have agreed to be a Governor of De Montfort University and a consultant to North West Water. Finally, I am now engaged, with Sir Rex Richards, In an urgent study for the Department of Health on how research might be safeguarded if the Hammersmith Hospital were transferred to the Charing Cross or the Charing Cross to Hammersmith.</p></span>"

                  "administrativeBackground": "<span class=\"wrapper\"><p>Sir David has kindly contributed the following autobiographical sketch. The original is included at A.74.</p> <p>Autobiographical sketch, February 1994.</p> <p>I was born on 7 March 1924 in Ellesmere, Shropshire, a small country town on the border between England and Wales. My father, Charles Harry Phillips, was a Master Tailor and a Methodist local preacher. My mother, Edith Harriet Phillips, was the daughter of Samuel Finney, one-time Secretary of the Midland Miners' Federation and Member of Parliament 1916-22: she was a London-trained midwife, the organist at Ellesmere Methodist Church and long a member of the Ellesmere Urban District Council. My unusual middle name is the maiden surname of my mother's great grandmother and it is a reminder of the family myth that we are related in some way to the Pilgrim Father, James Chilton.</p> <p>A key influence on my development came from my father, who was a very academically-inclined, thoughtful person who attempted to join the Wesleyan Methodist Ministry but failed, he always said, because his written sermon was not good enough. His extempore sermons, which he constructed in his head while he was sewing, were certainly powerful enough and I have sometimes wondered whether this background affected my own preference for speaking from rudimentary notes, or none at all.</p> <p>But the more formal academic influence came from my mother's side of the family. Her father was also a Methodist local preacher, this time Primitive Methodist, who taught himself New Testament Greek and his youngest daughter, my aunt Kathleen, went to Manchester University to read English. She married D.A.R. Clark, an engineering graduate of Manchester Tech (UMIST as it now is) who became a Technical College teacher, rising to be Principal of Middlesborough and then Nottingham Technical Colleges.</p> <p>These members of the family were important influences but even more important were my mother's cousins, J.F. and A.H. Bagnall. These were the sons of my grandmother's brother Joe, who worked as a Post Office clerk in Manchester and was again a Primitive Methodist local preacher. Jack and Herbert both went to Manchester Grammar School. Jack went on to read engineering at Manchester Tech while Herbert won a scholarship at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, read Greats and ended as classics master at Exeter School. Of the two Jack was the Influential figure. He went to work in India in the late twenties and used to come home on leave every three years. These were among the most memorable events in my childhood. This larger-than-life figure would descend on Ellesmere in a large car and waft us about the countryside exuding a great air of confidence and full of stories about the hardly dreamed of world out there. It was he, I believe, who instilled in me the thought that anything was possible.</p> <p>The Bagnalls seemed the dominant family in my early life. In addition to my grandmother, Mary Ellen, and her brother Joe there were three other brothers, Ted, Sam and Will, all local preachers, who had escaped from Ellesmere and lived respectively, when I first remember them, in Blandford Forum, Birmingham and Stroud. Ted and Will were both Liberal Party election agents and Sam worked, I believe, for the Shropshire Union Canal Company. His only son, Howard, read chemistry at Birmingham University and became City Analyst of Birmingham - another role model, though not as charismatic as his cousin Jack.</p> <p>My formal education was at the Church of England infants and elementary schools in Ellesmere and at the High School for Boys at Oswestry, some eight miles away on the Cambrian Railway. In 1942 I took Higher School Certificate in Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics, with subsidiary French and was awarded a State Bursary to study Physics, Mathematics and Radio Communications at University College, Cardiff, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Wales, where I took a war-time degree in June 1944. I then joined the Royal Navy for training as a Radar Officer, being posted to H.M.S. Illustrious in the Spring of 1945.</p> <p>After demobilisation in February 1947, I returned to Cardiff where I was awarded First-Class Honours in Physics in 1948 and began research in X-ray crystallography under the supervision of A.J.C.Wilson. As a graduate student I analysed the structures of ephedrine and one of the polymorphic forms of acridine and I played a part in developing the statistical tests for crystal symmetry that were devised in this period out of Wilson's work on the probability distribution of X-ray intensities.</p> <p>After taking my PhD in 1951, I joined the National Research Laboratories, Ottawa, Canada, as a Post-doctoral Fellow in the Crystallography Laboratory led by W.H. Barnes. First as a Post-doctoral Fellow (1951-53) and then as a member of the Research Staff (1953-55), I continued studies of the three-dimensional structures of relatively small molecules, extending the analyses to involve the use of three-dimensional data, developing the method of photographic data collection and introducing the use in Ottawa of digital computers - in collaboration with F.R. Ahmed, whom I helped to recruit.</p> <p>In 1955, on the suggestion of Dorothy Hodgkin, I was invited by W.L. Bragg to join the Research Staff of the Royal Institution, London, where Bragg was building up a team to work on protein crystals. On leaving Cambridge in 1954, Bragg had hoped to attract members of the Medical Research Council Research Unit at the Cavendish Laboratory (M.F. Perutz and J.C. Kendrew) to move to the Royal Institution with him, but they preferred to remain in Cambridge where their studies of haemoglobin and myoglobin had begun to develop well. They agreed to help Bragg, however, by collaborating with his new team in London. Consequently, on moving to the Royal Institution, I began to collaborate with J.C. Kendrew in his studies of myoglobin while at the same time collaborating with U.W. Arndt on the development of X-ray diffractometers. I used a semi-automatic four-circle diffractometer to measure some of the X-ray data that were used in the low-resolution analysis of the structure of sperm-whale myoglobin that was completed in 1958, and then went on to devise (with Arndt) an automatic diffractometer that incorporated an analogue computer - the Linear Diffractometer - while, at the same time, collaborating with Kendrew in extending the myoglobin analysis to high resolution. In this stage of the myoglobin work, the crystals were prepared at the Royal Institution (by V.C. Shore) and they were photographed partly in London and partly in Cambridge. The photographs were densitometered in the two centres and the final sets of data were assembled in Cambridge. The 2Å-resolution map of myoglobin - the first protein structure to be determined - was calculated in the autumn of 1959 and published in 1960.</p> <p>The Linear Diffractometer was developed commercially by Hilger &amp; Watts Ltd and was used in a number of subsequent crystallographic studies: C.C.F. Blake and I used the laboratory prototype, constructed by T.H. Faulkner in the Royal Institution workshop, to collect data to 1.4Å resolution for sperm-whale myoglobin. These data were used in a preliminary refinement of the structure at Cambridge in the period 1962-64, though the problem at this stage was beyond the power of current computers.</p> <p>It was in this period, in 1960, that I married Diana Kathleen Hutchinson, who was Bragg's secretary, and we had our only child Sarah Anne, born in 1962.</p> <p>In 1960, Roberto Poljak came to the Royal Institution as a post-doctoral worker and suggested that work on hen egg-white lysozyme might be successful-a proposal based upon his preliminary search for suitable heavy-atom derivatives at MIT under the guidance of Howard Dintzis, a myoglobin veteran. At this stage, I turned my attention to lysozyme and - with Bragg's encouragement - focused the greater part of the Royal Institution effort on the determination of its structure. In 1962 a promising low-resolution (6A) map of the enzyme was obtained - whereupon Poljak left the Royal Institution to work on genetics at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. At the Royal Institution, in collaboration particularly with A.C.T. North, C.C.F. Blake and V.R. Sarma, I concentrated on extending the analysis to high (2A) resolution and, at the same time, I initiated crystallographic studies of complexes between the enzyme and competitive inhibitors related to its substrate. These studies were carried out in collaboration with my research student, Louise N. Johnson.</p> <p>By the use of the Linear Diffractometer, now fitted with three detectors, and an in-house Elliott 803 computer provided by the Medical Research Council, these studies led to the calculation of a readily-interpretable electron-density map of the enzyme early in 1965 and the proposal of its mechanism of action about a year later.</p> <p>During this period of excitement arrangements were also being made for Bragg's retirement aged 75 and, as the result of proposals by Dorothy Hodgkin, J.W.S. Pringle and H.A. Krebs, I was offered a Professorship of Molecular Biophysics at Oxford. With the active support of the Medical Research Council, led by Sir H. Himsworth, I was able to take with me the greater part of the research group at the Royal Institution, with lecturerships for North and Blake, and to set up a new Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics. The laboratory was associated with the Department of Zoology, headed by Pringle, and plans were agreed to house it in the new Zoology building that was then being designed.</p> <p>We moved to Oxford in September 1966, being housed initially in the Old Physiology Building. In addition to the group from the Royal Institution I also recruited to University Lecturerships Drs A. Miller and R.E. Offord from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. Miller worked on fibrous proteins and muscle while Offord was a protein chemist so that, with North and Blake providing single-crystal expertise and with backgrounds, respectively, in physics and chemistry, we formed a reasonably well-balanced group to help extend studies of protein structure and function in Oxford. Louise Johnson rejoined us as a Departmental Demonstrator in 1967, after a post-doctoral year at Yale.</p> <p>In Oxford, I envisaged the Laboratory as a group of independent but closely interacting research teams led by the University Lecturers and myself. In particular, I attached great importance to having a lively protein chemistry group within the laboratory to interact with the structure analysts at all stages of their work from the identification of problems for research to the consideration of results and how best they might be developed in a biological context. Three of the four original University lecturers (North, Offord and Miller) left over the years and were replaced by L.N. Johnson, A.R. Rees and D.I. Stuart, of whom Rees also left for a Professorship elsewhere towards the end of my period in Oxford.</p> <p>Studies of lysozyme were continued, partly to develop new methods, but a major part of the effort, especially in the early years, was aimed at at detailed understanding of the enzymes in the glycolytic pathway. My part in this was the determination of the structure of triose-phosphate Isomerase together with substrate and inhibitor binding studies that revealed the structural features underlying the catalytic mechanism. This research programme also involved scientists in other Departments in Oxford who collaborated as members of the Oxford Enzyme Group of which I was one of the founders. The group was chaired initially by Sir Rex Richards and, under his leadership, concentrated on the development of NMR spectroscopy as applied to biological problems in parallel with the continuing development of X-ray crystallography - especially in the analysis of protein mobility. I became Chairman of the Group in 1984.</p> <p>Also in collaboration with members of the Enzyme Group, and encouraged by Rodney Porter and Edward Abraham, in the 1980s I concentrated more on studies of immunoglobulins and B-lactamases and, through discussions with F. Brown, I stimulated David Stuart's successful analysis of the structure of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus.</p> <p>In 1974 I was appointed a member of the Medical Research Council and the founder Chairman of the Cell Biology &amp; Disorders Board, one of the subsidiary Boards that was set up in a general reorganisation of the Council's operating structure in that year. I served as Board Chairman until 1976, during which time the most significant events were, probably, the continuing discussions with the Departments of Health (of England and Scotland) regarding the transfer of funds from the MRC to the Departments following the Rothschild Report of 1972, and the review of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the time of M.F. Perutz's formal retirement. This review led to the Phillips Report which proposed some re-balancing of the programme of work at LMB but successfully headed off those who were then criticising what they saw as the Council's over emphasis on Molecular Biology. I continued as a member of the MRC until 1978 and was subsequently the Royal Society assessor on the Council until 1983.</p> <p>In 1976 I was elected Biological Secretary and vice-president of the Royal Society and served in those capacities until 1983. During this time I played a part in abolishing the Society's longstanding small-grants scheme and replacing it with a scheme for the support of University Research Fellows which was designed to ensure the long-term support of highly-talented young scientists in advance of their obtaining academic appointments. Another activity was the preparation of evidence for Parliamentary Select Committees on a variety of subjects one of which, on the provision of scientific advice to government, may have had an influence on my next appointment. In this report the Society criticised the Advisory Board for the Research Councils and recommended that the Board should be reconstituted with a part-time chairman able to give two days a week to the task.</p> <p>In January 1983 I was appointed Chairman of the Advisory Board for the Research Councils (ABRC) on the terms proposed by the Royal Society report, for a four-year term of office. The appointment also carried with it ex-officio membership of the Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development (ACARD) and, subsequently, of its successor body the Advisory Council on Science &amp; Technology (ACOST). This continued until mid-1993. I was also involved from time to time in the discussions of Official Committees, whose duties are to prepare papers for meetings of Cabinet Committees.</p> <p>At this time, the ABRC was responsible for advising the Secretary of State for Education and Science on the size of the science budget, which was determined annually as a part of the Public Expenditure round, and how the funds that were made available should be distributed among the five Research Councils, the Royal Society, the Fellowship of Engineering and the Natural History Museum. In addition, the Board conducted or commissioned studies on various aspects of science policy and the state of the science base that were designed to help in the formulation of sound advice.</p> <p>For example, during my first term of office the Board published studies of 'Future Facilities for Advanced Research Computing'; 'High Energy Particle Physics in the United Kingdom'; the 'Evaluation of national performance in basic research'; 'Private Sector Funding of Scientific Research'; an 'International Comparison of Government Funding of Academic and Academically Related Research'; and 'Contract Researchers in Universities'. All of these promoted useful debate on topics that remained important throughout my chairmanship.</p> <p>In 1986 I agreed to serve as chairman for a second four year term and, apart from the regular business of the Board in relation to the size and distribution of the Science Budget, this period was dominated by the preparation and publication of two reports. The first of these, entitled 'A Strategy for the Science Base' (1987) addressed fundamental issues in the organisation of university research and provoked a great deal of debate. In particular, the proposition that some universities should expect to be engaged in substantial research activity across the range of fields, while others were engaged in substantial world class research in particular fields and a third group were engaged in the scholarship and research necessary to support and develop teaching, was greeted with outrage. Nevertheless, under the influence of the Research Selectivity Exercise, initiated by the University Grants Committee (UGC) in 1985 and repeated twice since then by the University Funding Council (UFC), together with the abolition of the binary line, which admitted former Polytechnics to University status, a differentiation of universities remarkably like that proposed by the ABRC has emerged. Another major recommendation of the report, that the allocation of responsibilities between Research Councils and Funding Councils within the dual support of university research should be shifted towards the Research Councils, has been accepted by government and implemented; while a further proposal, that interdisciplinary research should be promoted by the establishment of interdisciplinary research centres (IRCs), has also been implemented to a certain extent. Numbers of the other proposals, for example that the Research Councils should develop more explicit policies for the management of research manpower in universities, re-emerged in the White Paper of 1993.</p> <p>The second major report in this period arose from concern about the way in which support for biology was distributed across the Research Councils. Under the chairmanship of Mr J.R.S. Morris, a study group appointed to address this problem produced a wide-ranging report that proposed a radical reform of the Research Council system. They proposed that a single Research Council should be set up with operating divisions that would cover the responsibilities of the existing Research Councils distributed rather differently so that, for example, the responsibility for nonmedical biology would be concentrated in a single division. According to these proposals, the ABRC was to be replaced by the Council of the single research council with a part-time non-executive chairman and a full-time chief executive.</p> <p>In the autumn of 1989, the ABRC discussed this report and decided not to recommend its acceptance to ministers. However, they set up a small working party, comprising the heads of the Research Councils and two independent members of the Board under my chairmanship, to propose more modest changes to the existing system. Out of this process came proposals that the ABRC should be reconstituted under a full-time chairman and with a slimmed-down membership comprising the executive heads of the five Research Councils, six independent - or non-executive - members drawn from industry and academe, and two assessors - the Chief Scientific Advisor to the government and the Deputy Secretary with responsibility for the science base in the Department of Education &amp; Science. Specifically, the Chief Scientists from other government departments were to be removed from membership though they were to be guaranteed access to the Board for discussion of issues that particularly affected their departments.</p> <p>These proposals were accepted by government and the Board was reconstituted from 1 April 1990. I accepted an invitation to be the first full-time chairman for a three-year period.</p> <p>This reorganisation led to my resignation from my professorship in Oxford, a year earlier than I had expected, and my wife and I moved to London in July 1990. Meanwhile, the University had formally considered the future need for a Professorship of Molecular Biophysics and had agreed that the post should continue. Thanks to the generosity of Sir Edward Abraham, the Professorship was supported by an endowment and, at Sir Edward's suggestion, it was named the David Phillips Professorship of Molecular Biophysics. Shortly after my departure from Oxford, Dr Louise N. Johnson was appointed to the Chair.</p> <p>After the reconstitution of the ABRC the major benefits arose from changes in procedure that led the heads of Research Councils to play a fuller part in the Board's business and underlined more clearly than before the responsibilities of the Research Councils themselves to support the work of highest priority in their areas of interest instead of looking to government to provide extra resources to cover new scientific opportunities of high priority. This regime continued through the Public Expenditure rounds of 1990 and 1991 alongside a continuing programme of studies, now organised under the aegis of sub-committees of the Board. These included sub-committees of Manpower, Biotechnology, Super-computing and Science Policy, all of which were supported by members of the ABRC Secretariat and generated important reports and discussion papers. In addition, an Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change (IACGEC) was set up under my chairmanship to co-ordinate the thinking of funding agencies, including the Research Councils, the Met Office, the British National Space Centre, and other government departments - who were represented by the Department of the Environment - on this important and politically prominent issue.</p> <p>After the General Election of April 1992, the Prime Minister unexpectedly announced a reorganisation of the support for science and technology within government. Responsibility for the Science Budget - but not the Funding Council support for University research - was transferred from the DES to a new Office of Science &amp; Technology within the Office of Public Service &amp; Science under the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr William Waldegrave. The head of the OST was the Chief Science Advisor, Professor W.D.P. Stewart.</p> <p>Under these new arrangements, the Board continued to operate essentially as before but now submitting its advice on the Science Budget to the Chancellor of the Duchy. Almost immediately, however, the Chancellor announced his intention of publishing a White Paper on Science &amp; Technology in 1993 and the Board spent most of the summer and autumn of 1992 preparing its advice on the nature of this White Paper. This drew quite heavily on the 1987 Strategy Advice, the debates of 1989, which had led to the reconstitution of the Board, and the experience of the reconstituted Board. It was submitted on 30 October 1992 and proposed a revision of the Research Council system closely similar to that proposed in the Morris report.</p> <p>At about this time, in view of the perceived need to improve co-ordination between the Funding Council and Research Council components of the science base, I was appointed a member of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and an observer on the Welsh Higher Education Funding Council (HEFCW). These developments took place partly as a result of ABRC initiatives in holding meetings with Funding Council officials in Edinburgh and in Cardiff.</p> <p>ACOST, of which I was also a member, produced advice in parallel with that of the ABRC with which the ABRC did not agree. It envisaged, for example, a separate Research Council for the advancement of scientific knowledge alongside Councils for mission orientated research. The two sets of advice were presented by the chairman of ACOST and myself to a meeting of OST ministers and senior staff on 3 November 1992 and this was the beginning of a long process of debate and drafting within the OST and government generally that led, on 26 May 1993, to the publication of the White Paper.</p> <p>Recognising that the functions of the ABRC would have to continue until any changes announced in the White Paper could be put into effect, Mr Waldegrave asked me first to extend my chairmanship until 30 September 1993 and then until 31 December 1993 at which time, under the terms of the White Paper, the ABRC was to be abolished and its chairman replaced by a Director General of Research Councils.</p> <p>During the period from the publication of the White Paper to the end of the year, I played the part of Acting DGRC and, in particular, conducted an urgent study of the reallocation of resources to the new Research Councils, whose boundaries and missions were closely defined in the White Paper. My advice was accepted by the Chancellor at the end of July and I spent the remainder of the year helping to implement further White Paper decisions and playing a part in the appointment of non-executive chairman and chief executives for the new Research Councils. I retired on 31 December 1993 and Sir John Cadogan took over as DGRC.</p> <p>In retirement, I remain a non-executive director of Celltech, a position I have occupied since 1982; a Trustee of the Wolfson Foundation (first appointed in 1988); an editor of the Journal Biochemistry; a member of the Davy-Faraday Laboratory Committee of the Royal Institution; and non-executive chairman of Finsbury Communications, the company founded by my son-in-law, Dr Paul Matthewson. Furthermore, I have agreed to be a Governor of De Montfort University and a consultant to North West Water. Finally, I am now engaged, with Sir Rex Richards, In an urgent study for the Department of Health on how research might be safeguarded if the Hammersmith Hospital were transferred to the Charing Cross or the Charing Cross to Hammersmith.</p></span>",

Additional explanatory notes, Information and cross-references are appended where appropriate to the separate sections, sub-sections and individual entries in the body of the catalogue. The following paragraphs are intended only to draw attention to items of particular interest.</p> <p>Section A (Biographical and autobiographical), though not extensive, covers in varying detail the principal stages of Phillips's career from schooldays onward: It includes many offers of appointments not otherwise documented as well as the known public honours he received. It also includes several autobiographical accounts prepared by Phillips at various dates; similar occasional accounts occur elsewhere in the collection and attention is drawn to them in the catalogue entries.</p> <p>Section B (Diaries and notebooks) is of interest for a series of notebooks which constitute a general journal of considerable value in several regards. The books, covering the years 1960-90 (with an unexplained gap from 1976 to 1984), contain Phillips's notes on scientific research projects and progress, Interviews and discussions with colleagues, staff and visitors in the laboratory, salaries, funding and laboratory requirements, aides-memoire on telephone conversations or letters received, drafts for lectures or conference papers, comments on theses or papers sent for comment, notes taken at lectures, seminars or conferences, and in the later years notes of ABRC or Research Council meetings and discussions on science policy.</p> <p>Section C (Research notebooks and notes) provides records, some by collaborators and not always in full detail, for all stages of Phillips's career from his post-doctoral appointment in 1951 at the National Research Laboratories Ottawa. The material is presented by topic. These include the development at the Royal Institution London (with U.W. Arndt) of the semi-automatic and later of the linear diffractometer, and collaborative work with J.C. Kendrew (later Sir John) and his team at Cambridge on the structure of myoglobin. Phillips's most widely known achievement, the structure of lysozyme and its mechanism of action, on which he continued to work for most of his career, is documented here by his detailed records of the co-ordinates. Later projects at Oxford such as the successful analysis of triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) are also documented.</p> <p>However, not all Phillips's research career is fully covered by the surviving material in this collection. His activity as a founder member and later chairman of the Oxford Enzyme Group (OEG) can be found in the collection of the OEG papers held in the Bodleian Library, and a detailed record of all stages of the myoglobin project is contained in the manuscript collection of Sir John Kendrew also held in the Bodleian Library.</p> <p>Section D (The Royal Institution) is relatively short, but contains records not only of the important decade in Phillips's career from his appointment as a Research Fellow in 1956 by W.L. Bragg until his appointment at Oxford in 1966, but also of his continuing involvement with the Institution as Manager, member of Council, lecturer and active participant in its affairs including the award of its Actonian Prize in 1991. For the early period the material is mainly correspondence, on the equipment and research projects referred to in relation to Section C, and on the events surrounding the successful lysozyme analysis. Several of Phillips's long-term colleagues at the Institution accompanied him to Oxford, in particular C.C.F. Blake, A.C.T. North and L.N. Johnson.</p> <p>The Director of the Royal Institution throughout Phillips's decade there was W.L. Bragg (Sir Lawrence Bragg). Their mutual affectionate regard can be seen both in this Section and passim elsewhere in the collection.</p> <p>Section E (Oxford) shows Phillips moving to a wider stage. As the University's first Professor of Molecular Biophysics from 1966 he had the responsibility of setting up and running a new department and of establishing the subject as an integral part of Oxford science. There were difficulties to be overcome both before and after the move from London, notably over the status and salaries of the team-members hitherto paid by the Medical Research Council, delays over the promised new Zoology Department building in which the Laboratory was to be housed, and the assurance of continued funding from MRC and other outside bodies for powerful computing capacity and for specific research projects. The Chair also carried with it the obligation to participate in the general administation of the University through faculty and inter-faculty boards, the organisation of syllabuses, teaching and advanced study, appointments and elections to posts in the Laboratory and in the University at large. All these activites are well documented. Phillips's success can be gauged in part from the very large number of requests to work, visit, conduct collaborative projects or consult with him and his colleagues. Many of the documents relating to these matters bear annotations, comments or information from the Laboratory team, since Phillips continued there the practice he had begun on a more limited scale at the Royal Institution of circulating all but personal communications to senior laboratory members, to keep them fully informed of events and to solicit their advice or views.</p> <p>Although Phillips's Chair carried with it a Fellowship of Corpus Christi College, he did not play a particularly active part in college life, choosing rather to give his time and energy to the scientific world at Oxford and outside.</p> <p>Section F (Publications) includes some drafts and material for Phillips's own scientific papers, though fewer than might be expected. During his most active research period he was a reluctant writer and rarely kept documentation once a paper was published. His major papers on lysozyme are, however, well documented, especially his 1966 article in Scientific American which was illustrated by hand-drawn diagrams specially commissioned from the artist Irving Geis. This was a rare solution to the recurring problem of presenting three-dimensional results on the printed page, which in the 1960s and 1970s usually Involved red-green diagrams and filter spectacles for the reader.</p> <p>Also of interest is the extensive material assembled by Phillips for his Memoir of W.L. Bragg written for the Royal Society and published in 1979.</p> <p>Phillips found time to act as referee or editorial consultant to many publishing houses though he was obliged to decline very many requests to undertake such work. Specialist journals with which he had long connections as contributor, editor or consultant include Acta Crystallographica, Biochemistry, EMBO Journal and Journal of Molecular Biology. The principal publishing houses with which he was involved were IRL Press, Medical and Technical Publishing Company and Oxford University Press. His editorial and advisory work for the Royal Society is documented in Section L.</p> <p>Section G (Conferences, visits, lectures) is the most extensive in the collection, reflecting Phillips's close involvement in the diffusion of scientific information and his success therein. The time-span covered is 1957-93, including an addendum for items received at a late date. The introduction to Section G describes in more detail the content of the material and its interest as witness to the evolution of Phillips's research, the range of audience addressed, and his gifts as a refreshing speaker on technical and, later, science policy topics.</p> <p>Section H (Radio, television, films) is very short and not a full record of Phillips's activity in these fields. It does, however, document his work for the Open University, Including a prize-winning film on lysozyme.</p> <p>Section J (UK societies, organisations, consultancies) records, in varying detail, Phillips's involvement with over a score of such organisations. Attention is drawn in particular to the material on the British Crystallographic Association which includes many of the founding and fund-raising early papers of the Association, the CIBA Foundation which was one of Phillips's major commitments (he served on the Council of the Foundation for sixteen years), and Celltech, an enterprise set up to exploit discoveries in biotechnology.</p> <p>Section K (International societies, organisations, consultancies), while containing similar material concerning overseas organisations, includes a higher proportion of work on advisory boards or scientific councils of laboratories and institutions relating to their research programmes. Examples are the Basle University Biozentrum, the Committee for the European Development of Science and Technology (CODEST), the Harvard-Monsanto Research Agreement (an experiment in collaborative research between industry and academia), the 'Single-crystal intensity measurement programme' and other affairs of the International Union of Crystallography, the International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB), the Max-Planck institute of Biochemistry Scientific Council, and the Weizmann Institute Israel.</p> <p>Section L (The Royal Society) provides useful documentation of Phillips's long association with the Society, notably his service as Biological Secretary 1976-83. It includes work on various committees, sometimes as chairman, overseas visits and delegations, editorial and advisory work for the Society's publications, material on the organisation of the Fellowship and its Sectional committees, elections and awards, and general correspondence of the Society's affairs.</p> <p>Section M (Science Research Council) is short, relating mainly to the Cray Computer and the Daresbury Laboratory.</p> <p>Section N (Medical Research Council) is an extensive record of Phillips's service as a Council member 1974-78 and a Royal Society 'Attending Assessor' 1976-83. The introduction to the Section outlines more fully his wide-ranging work for the Council as Chairman of the Cell Board and member of many committees, working parties and delegations such as those set up consider the Cambridge Laboratory of Molecular Biology, the European Laboratory of Molecular Biology (EMBL) and the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR).</p> <p>Section O (Advisory Board for the Research Councils) (ABRC) records Phillips's career as government adviser, from his appointment as part-time Chairman of ABRC in January 1983 through his appointment as full-time Chairman from April 1990 (when he resigned his Oxford Chair) to the period following the General Election of May 1992. Immediately after the election, changes were announced in government organisation for education and science which meant that responsibility for science and technology was transferred from the Department of Education and Science (to whose Secretaries of State Phillips had hitherto addressed the ABRC's advice) to the newly-created Office of Science and Technology under the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Phillips's extended period of service as ABRC Chairman ended in September 1993, but he remained as acting Director-General of the Research Councils until December 1993.</p> <p>Section P (Correspondence) is extensive. Always conducted in easy and friendly terms, it is primarily concerned with projects in protein research. It includes useful exchanges with colleagues on myoglobin and lysozyme. There is also further material relating to W.L. Bragg.</p> <p>Section R (References and recommendations) is also extensive and demonstrates the international respect in which Phillips was held by the many requests for advice or evaluation on appointments from universities and institutions worldwide. There is also a very large number of research grant assessments.</p> <p>Conditions of restricted access apply to this and to other Sections of the collection.Visits</p> <p>L.31-L.33A General correspondence</p> <p>L.34-L.38 Organisation of the Fellowhip</p> <p>L.39-L.62 Elections, appointments, awards</p> <p>SECTION M SCIENCE RESEARCH COUNCIL/SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL (SRC/SERC) M.1-M.13</p> <p>SECTION N MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (MRC) N.1-N.64</p> <p>N.1 Council correspondence</p> <p>N.2-N.21 Boards and committees</p> <p>N.22-N.47 Sub-committees, review groups, working parties</p> <p>N.48-N.52 Visits to MRC laboratories and units</p> <p>N.53-N.64 Conferences and discussion meetings</p> <p>SECTION O ADVISORY BOARD FOR THE RESEARCH COUNCILS (ABRC) O.1-O.261</p> <p>O.1-O.5 Appointments and personal</p> <p>O.6-O.14 Structure and Membership</p> <p>O.15-O.49 Research councils</p> <p>O.50-O.58 UK scientific and academic Institutions</p> <p>O.59-O.68 UK science policy institutions and pressure groups</p> <p>O.69-O.79 Parliamentary select committees</p> <p>O.80-O.97 Government departments</p> <p>O.98-O.105 Science policy studies</p> <p>O.106-O.120 Reports and working parties</p> <p>O.121-O.123 Serminars and conferences</p> <p>O.124-O.126 Miscellaneous committees and sub-committees</p> <p>O.127-O.141 International relations and collaboration</p> <p>O.142-O.175 Visits and engagements</p> <p>O.176-O.203 ABRC submissions and advice</p> <p>O.204-O.219 1993 White Paper and boundary study</p> <p>O.220-O.234 Memoranda and meetings 1982-93</p> <p>O.235-O.247 General correspondence 1983-93</p> <p>O.248-O.261 Addendum</p> <p>SECTION P CORRESPONDENCE P.1-P.304</p> <p>P.1-P.292 Scientific and general correspondence</p> <p>P.293-P.296 Shorter scientific correspondence</p> <p>P.297-P.304 Unindexed correspondence</p> <p>SECTION R REFERENCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS R.1-R.159</p> <p>R.1-R.3 Theses and higher degrees</p> <p>R.4-R.6 University external examining</p> <p>R.7-R.66 University appointments</p> <p>R.67, R.68 Agricultural Research Council/ Agricultural and Food Research Council</p> <p>R.69-R.83 Medical Research Council</p> <p>R.84-R.104 Science Research Council/ Science and Engineering Research Council</p> <p>R.105-R.125 UK foundations and grant-giving institutions</p> <p>R.126-R.152 Overseas foundations and grant-giving Institutions</p> <p>R.153-R.155 Awards, prizes, honours</p> <p>R.156-R.159 Personal</p> <p>The material is presented as shown in the List of Contents.

Sir David has taken an active interest in the scientific archives project since its inception in 1973 and Mrs Jeannine Alton who has now catalogued the Phillips papers for the NCUACS was in charge of the archives work in Oxford from 1973 until the transfer of operations to the University of Bath in 1987. The more immediate impetus for the Phillips cataloguing project, however, was Sir David's resignation in 1990 from his Professorship of Molecular Biophysics at Oxford University to assume the full-time Chairmanship of the Advisory Board for the Research Councils in London. The imminence of his departure from Oxford led to discussions with Sir David about the very substantial archive in his Oxford laboratory, a detailed archival assessment of their quantity, nature and importance for a wide range of aspects of the history of science, and the development of a funding proposal for submission to the Leverhulme Trust. We were very fortunate to secure funding from the Trust for two years with an extension for a third year as the science policy interest of Phillips's career took on a greater archival importance than had originally been anticipated. Sir David has been supportive throughout with advice and encouragement and Mrs Alton's expertise and experience has magnificently met the challenge of difficult technical material, the complexity of UK and international science organisation and the piecemeal delivery of papers over an extended period.</p> <p>The NCUACS would like to take this opportunity to record our gratitude to the Director of the Leverhulme Trust, Sir Rex Richards, and the Leverhulme Trustees for their support of the scientific archives work since the transfer of operations to Bath in 1987. This has taken the form of three major cataloguing projects: the papers of Sir John Kendrew (1987-1989), Sir David Phillips (1991-1994) and Professor Dorothy Hodgkin OM (1992-1994). The three collections are deposited in the Bodleian Library, Oxford where they form an indispensable corpus of material for the history of twentieth-century British science.</p> <p>Peter Harper</p> <p>Archivist, NCUACS</p> <p>February 1994</p> <p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</p> <p>Thanks are due primarily to Sir David Phillips for initially allowing his papers to go forward for cataloguing and for making additional material available on a continuing basis. He has been generous with his time and attention for consultation, and, in addition to the autobiographical account quoted above, has made invaluable comments on the catalogue drafts throughout the lengthy process of compilation. Lady Phillips has also contributed much valued information and advice.</p> <p>Mrs Pam Batchelor, Phillips's former secretary at Oxford, was very helpful in overseeing and advising on the transfer of material from the laboratory.</p> <p>Members of the NCUACS, Peter Harper and Timothy E. Powell, and of the staff of the Department of Western Manuscripts of the Bodleian Library have helped at all stages with advice and information.</p> <p>Hazel Gott has earned much gratitude for the patience and skill she has brought to the processing and revising of the catalogue.</p> <p>Jeannine Alton</p> <p>BATH 1994</p>\"</span>"
