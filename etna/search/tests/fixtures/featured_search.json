These are the documents that, when you open the box, you immediately jump to put the top back on and quickly hide it at the bottom of the pile, hoping that it will miraculously disappear!</p>\n<div class=\"more\"><span id=\"more-1333\"/></div>\n<p>Well, here in the Collection Care Department we are rising to the daunting challenges these documents present to the conservation professional!</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes we manage the ‘Unfit Database’ – a record of all 8,232 items in the collection previously identified as at risk and that had been removed from public access for this reason. Over the past couple of years we have been committed to reducing the number of documents classed as ‘unfit’ by applying a more consistent approach to categorising documents and enabling new ways to support readers with these fragile items. Many formerly unfit items can now be seen under supervision in our invigilation room or in the Collection Care Department where staff will be available to assist you in handling these fragile documents. In fact, over 75% of those documents that were previously inaccessible can now be seen immediately! But we’re not going to stop there…</p>\n<p>Items currently identified as unfit for production are actually of two very different types: those that require mould cleaning and those that require extensive conservation treatment.</p>\n<p>Those documents identified as mould damaged need to be cleaned. Mould needs to be removed, as active spores can quickly spread to unaffected documents. Mould cleaning is something we do routinely on request and can be arranged in advance of your visit provided we are given a certain amount of notice. In fact, approximately 65% of those documents that cannot be produced immediately fall into this category.</p>\n<p>Unfit items that need conservation treatment before they can be produced are considerably more labour and time intensive. They will require an individual specialist conservation assessment, research into possible treatment options and time to test and carry out the conservation treatment. However, if an unfit item is vital for research please <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">contact</a> staff at Kew with your query. The Collection Care Department is also investigating future projects that will hopefully enable us to further systematically reduce the number of unfit documents.</p>\n<p>Ultimately we’d like to see the number of unfit documents reduced to zero. Maybe that’s possible and maybe it isn’t, but we still want to get as many of them into your hands as we can!</p>"

A  new senior conservation scientist, Lucia, has also joined us: she will undertake dynamic long-term projects including research into wax seals and consolidants for paints. The researchers are also contributing to the wider field of heritage science through dissemination activities and collaborations.</p>\n<p>In the first of this two-part blog series, our new staff have outlined their research interests and activities; find out more about our two 3D printing fellows and conservation intern.</p>\n<h3>Ellen Valter, 3D Printing Fellow</h3>\n<h4>What did you do before you joined The National Archives?</h4>\n<p>I very recently completed Cultural Heritage Conservation post-graduate studies at Fleming College in Ontario, Canada, after a career in another field. I am thrilled to be at The National Archives to help the Collection Care department further the initiatives it has on the go.</p>\n<h4>What are you researching?</h4>\n<p>I have determined that the chemical stability of 3D printing filaments continues to be problematic for conservation applications. I am exploring other 3D imaging and printing applications for outreach in an archives context.</p>\n<h4>How will the research you’re conducting help you in the future?</h4>\n<p>Traditional and non-traditional audience engagement is a rapidly developing area with technological developments available for adaptation and deployment. It’s something that other institutions are exploring as well.</p>\n<h3>Bogdan Luca, 3D Printing Fellow</h3>\n<h4>What did you do before you joined The National Archives?</h4>\n<p>I am currently studying at UCL towards an MSci Chemistry degree. I have also been 3D printing for the past two and a half years: I first started using the technique while I was in high school in Romania.</p>\n<h4>What are you researching?</h4>\n<p>The initial aim of our research project at The National Archives was to create custom housing for fragile collection items. However, after discovering that there are no suitable materials to 3D print with, I steered my focus towards developing a suitable, easy-to-follow photogrammetry procedure that the staff at The National Archives can use. I have also focused on creating sets of instructions for post-processing the photogrammetry results and creating textured virtual copies of the scanned objects.</p>\n<h4>How will the research you’re conducting help you in the future?</h4>\n<p>The research at The National Archives definitely got me interested in 3D imaging methods. I would say that this six-week fellowship may help me towards a career in this area. However, at the moment I’m still a student and I’m trying to balance my studies with my career and my interests – so it’s definitely hard to say what the future holds for me.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_43165\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"max-width: 768px;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-43165 img-responsive colorbox-43157\" src=\"https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/01140434/rat-housing-768x576.jpg\" alt=\"Experimental housing for a 3D printed surrogate of Sir Henry Cole’s rat, constructed through inter-institutional collaboration\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/01140434/rat-housing-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/01140434/rat-housing-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/01140434/rat-housing-777x583.jpg 777w, https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/01140434/rat-housing-210x158.jpg 210w, https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/01140434/rat-housing.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Experimental housing for a 3D printed surrogate of Sir Henry Cole’s rat, constructed through inter-institutional collaboration</p></div>\n<h3>Rebecca Sawyer, Preventative Conservation Intern</h3>\n<h4>What did you do before you joined The National Archives?</h4>\n<p>I am a part-time student at Northumbria University studying Preventive Conservation. I am here on a six-week placement, from mid-February until the end of March.</p>\n<h4>What are you researching?</h4>\n<p>My Work Placed Learning Project is investigating how an ATP testing kit – which measures Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), which is present in all living or once-living cells – can be used at The National Archives. I am testing shelves and boxes in the repositories to see if the ATP kit can be used to check when cleaning needs to be done in different areas of the repositories to support a change in the cleaning regime.</p>\n<p>I am shadowing Amy Sampson in the Preventive Conservation department in the annual recalibration of the Hanwell Environmental devices. I am inspecting materials which have been brought on site for exhibition and display, assisting generally where possible, and doing as much training and research as can fit in a six-week placement!</p>\n<h4>How will the research you’re conducting help you in the future?</h4>\n<p>The practical part of my research project is informing my research for dissertation, which will discuss air-borne particulates in a heritage environment.</p>\n<p>During my time here, I have received a lot support in accessing articles and research journals as well as training sessions: the conservation team in Collection Care have been really generous in sharing their time and expertise. One of the most striking and remarkable aspects of the department is the culture of skills-sharing and professional development.</p>"

Time certainly flies and the end of this year will mark my fourth year in the role (with a short inter regnum in 2012). Our magazine, Magna, is published in April, August and December. The production of the magazine may seem all calm and measured, akin to one of the swans serenely progressing across the lake. However, in reality there are bursts of frenzied activity several months or so before each edition appears. A lot occurs out of sight so I thought I would take you behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>The Friends were formed in 1988 and the magazine started life as a four, or sometimes eight, page newsletter. In 1992 the format was changed to an A5 sized parish magazine style. It contained features, snippets and short articles about the records held at the then Public Record Office (PRO). The magazine was imaginatively called Prophile to reflect the Friends’ association with the PRO. In 2007 the format changed to A4 and colour covers were introduced. With the change to The National Archives the magazine title became the rather cumbersome Magazine of the Friends of The National Archives. We switched to our current title in 2012 to once again reflect our connection.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-18506\"/>To mark our twenty-fifth anniversary we introduced four colour pages and increased the size to 28 pages. This year we have made further changes thanks to the tumbling costs of digital printing. The magazine is now full colour throughout, the size increased to 32 pages, whilst the cost has reduced by nearly a third.</p>\n<p>One of the fortunate challenges I face with every edition is deciding what to leave out because of space constraints. White space and nothing to fill it is an editor’s nightmare. There isn’t really a beginning to an edition, it is rather a seamless process as I work at least one edition ahead, sometimes two, to ensure I have plenty of material and choice available. Now that we have the services of a professional designer and compiler I can happily leave all those spacing issues for him to sort out. When I was compiling the magazine it was rather daunting – make a minor change on page two and something horrible would happen on page 15, hopelessly throwing my best intentions into turmoil! Those days have gone and I just potter along very contently sourcing topics and material.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18510\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" style=\"max-width: 384px;\"><a href=\"https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/01163236/bt-design-e1409139662911.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-18510 size-medium img-responsive colorbox-18506\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bt-design-384x371.jpg\" alt=\"Design from Board of Trade (BT 43/103.340540)\" width=\"384\" height=\"371\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Design from Board of Trade (BT 43/103.340540)</p></div>\n<p>I have splendid support from the records specialists in Advice and Records Knowledge – for that I am very grateful. I am always mindful that asking for an article means extra work on top of a busy schedule. However, members of staff often contact me offering their suggestions for articles and features. The magazine is for the membership and I always encourage members to make a contribution and share their research interests. If you are a Friend and you feel you have an article to be written – <a href=\"http://www.friendsofthenationalarchives.org.uk/\">do get in touch</a>. I also spend a lot of time looking through <a href=\"http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/\">Discovery</a> to identify records that may be of interest. I have learnt so much from just rummaging and talking to many people about their research interests.</p>\n<p>When I took over the editorship I was keen to highlight the documents themselves, rather than just the message and information that they conveyed. The type and physical attributes of a source are just as important and so with this in mind there are now regular and fascinating contributions from <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/collection-care.htm\">Collection care</a>. Features have been introduced that focus on a specific map, photograph and document in each edition. Variety is important but it is a very tall order trying to include something for everyone in each edition. I try to achieve a reasonable balance over the three editions of the volume, and with over a thousand years of history the choice is considerable.</p>\n<p>There is also a rich collection of visual images to draw from in the collections to include in the magazine. Some of the images, for example the <a href=\"http://apps.nationalarchives.gov.uk/designregisters/\">Board of Trade design registers</a> (BT 43), or the Empire Marketing Board posters (<a href=\"http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C5145\">CO 956</a>) are quite stunning. Now that we have colour throughout this has opened up more options for presentation.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18508\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"max-width: 384px;\"><a href=\"https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/01163235/magna-april-2014.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-18508 size-medium img-responsive colorbox-18506\" src=\"https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/01163235/magna-april-2014.jpg\" alt=\"April 2014 edition of Magna magazine\" width=\"384\" height=\"537\" srcset=\"https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/01163235/magna-april-2014.jpg 675w, https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/01163235/magna-april-2014-214x300.jpg 214w, https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/01163235/magna-april-2014-186x260.jpg 186w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">April 2014 edition of Magna magazine</p></div>\n<p>When articles are submitted they are circulated electronically to our team of six proofreaders. Initially an article is checked by one person and returned to me for amendment and sorting out queries with the author. Once that is done the articles are sent off to our designer and compiler. There is a lot of to and fro between us as we work out the best sequence so that everything fits together neatly. Once we have a completed draft it is circulated to the proofreading team for final comment and tidy-up. With the final amendments all resolved the magazine is uploaded to the printers in Buxton.</p>\n<p>It takes about a week for the magazine to be printed and sent by courier to Kew. On hand is another small band of volunteers – fondly referred to as ‘the stuffing party’. Their not inconsiderable task is to put the magazines and any flyers into labelled envelopes for posting. Some members take their magazine in electronic format and others collect their copy from Kew, but that still leaves just under 900 envelopes to be ‘stuffed’!</p>\n<p>And so with a gentle thud the latest edition of the magazine arrives through the letterbox in households far and wide. It is so satisfying to see the finished product, the result of many dedicated volunteers’ hours supporting the Friends through researching, commissioning, preparing, proofreading, formatting, approving for printing and then finally despatching from Kew.</p>\n<p>However, print deadline days are always a scene of utter tranquillity and contentment. With a quiet determination and gentle ruthless efficiency all that needs to be done has been sorted. It is just a matter of deciding whether to have that second mug of coffee and ponder the cunning plan for future editions … another biscuit anyone?</p>"

Our object will then be to turn northwards, taking the enemy’s lines in flank and reverse, the bulk of the cavalry co-operating on the outer flank of this operation while suitable detachments will be detailed to cover the movement from any offensive of the enemy from the east. For the latter purpose the line LES COEUFS – BAPAUME – high ground east of MORY – high ground west of CROISILLES – MONCHY-le-PREUX is of tactical importance. The front gained between the rivers SOMME and ANCRE will meanwhile be maintained by part of the forces available.</p><p data-block-key=\"7tsq9\">During which phase of the operations the enemy’s resistance is likely to break down it is impossible to foretell, but the Army Commander wishes to be prepared for the most favourable situation to ourselves, while at the same time running no risk of a less favourable situation finding us unprepared.</p><p data-block-key=\"dl620\">If the enemy’s resistance breaks down during the first phase of the operations it is necessary to have the cavalry close at hand to exploit out success and that all other troops should make way for their advance.

The enemy in the front line was preparing to meet the assaulting columns with bombs, but so quickly were the 2nd GORDON HIGHLANDERS upon them that the defence was quite ineffective – bombs being thrown without withdrawing the pins.</p><p data-block-key=\"dji0q\">Casualties were now heavy but the line pushed steadily on, with the exception of the left company which was most unfortunately held up by uncut wire.</p><p data-block-key=\"6ef4n\">This was the only wire on our front which had not been thoroughly cut through; every effort had been made to complete it, but it appeared to present special difficulties to the Artillery. With this exception the cutting of the wire was most thorough.</p><p data-block-key=\"3gk55\">This uncut wire undoubtedly caused many casualties and greatly delayed the advance.</p><p

At the heart of this trial was anxiety about lesbian relationships and the profile that this trial might give to such relationships between women.

Born in Canada, she travelled to Europe, and in the early 20th century became a much-celebrated dancer on the West End stage. By 1906 she was attracting audiences in the headline role of a production of ‘Salome’, based on Oscar Wilde’s controversial play about the biblical figure. Salome was said to have danced before Herod with the head of John the Baptist on a silver plate. Allan quickly became renowned for her seductive dance based on this play.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    \n        <div id=\"on-the-stage\" class=\"section-separator\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h2 class=\"section-separator__heading\">\n            On the stage\n        </h2>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n    \n        \n\n<div class=\"content-block\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h2 class=\"content-block__heading\">\n            [Heading goes here]\n        </h2>\n        <div class=\"content-block__text\">\n            <p data-block-key=\"kv7w1\">By 1918 she had reprised the role, working with the Dutch theatre impresario J T Grein. To be an audience member of Allan’s private performance of 'Salome', spectators had to apply to ‘9 Duke Street, Adelphi, W6’. This was a way of escaping the censorship of the Lord Chamberlain, who had banned Oscar Wilde’s works in the aftermath of his trial. An advertisement for the performance was printed in the <i>Sunday Times</i>:</p><p data-block-key=\"fadj5\">OSCAR WILDE'S SALOME</p><p data-block-key=\"52rdf\">MAUD ALLAN in private performances by</p><p data-block-key=\"df6m2\">J.

In the pages of this publication, Pemberton-Billing wrote an article under the sensational headline, ‘The Cult of the Clitoris’. Pemberton-Billing used this article to harshly critique Allan’s upcoming performance and implied that Allan was a lesbian, and a member of a ‘cult’ of women who loved women.</p><p data-block-key=\"eu6kd\">[INSERT IMAGE HERE]</p><p data-block-key=\"2a9b\">While same sex relationships between women were never illegal, unlike homosexual acts between men, it was nevertheless socially unacceptable and attracted controversy. Even more shockingly, Pemberton-Billing accused Allan of having an affair with Margaret Asquith, the former Prime Minister’s wife. These accusations threatened to have a serious effect on Allan’s career, and so she took Pemberton-Billing to court.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    \n        <div id=\"the-trial\" class=\"section-separator\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h2 class=\"section-separator__heading\">\n            The trial\n        </h2>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n    \n        \n\n<div class=\"content-block\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h2 class=\"content-block__heading\">\n            [Heading goes here]\n        </h2>\n        <div class=\"content-block__text\">\n            <p data-block-key=\"4nldc\">The trial ran over six days. Pemberton-Billing made the trial even more of a spectacle by providing his own defence.</p><p data-block-key=\"1gnjj\">Rather than focusing on the libel accusation, the presiding judge seemed more concerned that the uncensored play was being performed on stage. In his closing statement, the judge noted that the costume Allan wore for her performance was ‘in fact ... worse than nothing’. Despite being the plaintiff, Allan herself seemed to be on trial. Ultimately the jury found Pemberton-Billing not guilty, at which there was said to be a great outburst of cheering in the gallery.</p><p data-block-key=\"d6e27\">[INSERT IMAGE HERE]</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n    \n        <div id=\"later-life\" class=\"section-separator\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h2 class=\"section-separator__heading\">\n            Later life\n        </h2>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n    \n        \n\n<div class=\"content-block\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h2 class=\"content-block__heading\">\n            [Heading goes here]\n        </h2>\n        <div class=\"content-block__text\">\n            <p data-block-key=\"ind33\">Despite Allan’s strenuous denial of Pemberton-Billing’s accusations, Margaret Asquith paid for her apartment overlooking Regent’s Park, until Herbert Asquith’s death in the late 1920s. Furthermore, it was in this apartment that Allan lived with Verna Aldrich, her secretary and lover.</p><p data-block-key=\"8ka07\">[INSERT IMAGE HERE]</p><p data-block-key=\"5qds0\">[INSERT 'FEATURED RECORD' COMPONENT BELOW - RECORD NOT AVAILABLE]</p><p data-block-key=\"49ego\">Allan eventually settled in Los Angeles during the Second World War and worked in the aircraft industry.
