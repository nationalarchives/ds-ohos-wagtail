Her father, who was already working in the powder factory, asked the manager for a job for his daughter. She worked in the canteen,  serving and cleaning for four years, and she remembers vividly the big explosion of 1957:  ‚ÄúI was at the tub and there was a bang, and the tub and the chair, went sliding down the canteen, but not a drop of water spilled out from it.  And we ran to the window and Mrs Williams shouted, 'Don't go to the windows, it's dangerous.'  Four were killed that day, in that cwt. It was a dangerous place, but you never thought about it when you were there.‚Äù She also remembers the time they were filming 'Inn of the Sixth Happiness' in Penrhyn and she and a friend sneaked out of work to get Ingrid Bergman's autograph! She married a man who also worked there, leaving to have her first child in 1959 and didn't return to the factory  afterwards but says that her time in Cookes was the happiest in her working life.","descriptionCy":"Gweithiodd Marion yn gyntaf fel nyrs blant ar √¥l gadael yr ysgol, ac yna dychwelodd i Benrhyndeudraeth. Gofynnodd ei thad, a oedd  eisoes yn gweithio yn y ffatri bowdwr, i'r rheolwr a oedd swydd i'w ferch. Bu'n gweithio yn y ffreutur, yn gweini a glanhau am bedair blynedd, ac mae'n cofio'n dda y ffrwydriad mawr yn 1957: ‚ÄúOn i wrth y crwc, a dyma 'na glec, a dyma'r crwc, a'r gadair 'ma, yn llithran ar hyd y cant√Æn fel 'na, a dim dropyn o dd≈µr yn disgyn ohoni.  A dyma ni i gyd yn rhedeg am y ffenestr, a Mrs Williams yn gweiddi, 'Peidiwch  √¢ mynd i'r ffenestr, mae peryg gwydrau.' Cafodd pedwar eu lladd y diwrnod hwnnw, yn y cwt 'na.  Roedd o'n lle peryglus, ond doeddech chi ddim yn meddwl am hynny pan oeddech chi yno.‚Äù Mae hefyd yn cofio'r adeg roedden nhw'n ffilmio 'Inn of the Sixth Happiness' a llithrodd hi a ffrind allan o'r gwaith i gael llofnod Ingrid Bergman! Priododd hi ddyn a oedd yn gweithio yno hefyd a gadawodd hi i gael ei phlentyn cyntaf, yn 1959.

J. Berwyn (1836-1917) was written specifially to serve the educational needs of the children of the Welsh Settlement.  The first edition appeared in 1878 and the second edition, shown here (which included a number of additions), was published in 1881.  R. J. Berwyn was assisted in the work by Thomas Pugh, Llandderfel.  The textbook contains a useful vocabulary, lessons, poems, sayings and stories, as well as a list of Welsh children's names.  This was the first Welsh book to be published in Patagonia.    \n\nRichard  Jones (Berwyn) was born in Glyndyfrdwy, Merionethshire.  He lived for a while in London and the United States, but returned to Wales when he heard of the Rev. Michael D. Jones's plan to establish a Welsh settlement.  He adopted the name 'Berwyn' shortly after he emigrated to Patagonia in 1865. \n\nR. J. Berwyn was a writer and prominent figure in the history of the Welsh Settlement. He was the Settlement's first registrar of births, marriages and deaths, and was also responsible for editing its first Welsh newspaper, 'Y Brut' (1868).  He held a number of public posts, which included secretary of the governing Council, secretary of the Welsh courts, postmaster, and teacher.  With the assistance of Thomas Pugh, Llandderfel, he wrote a Welsh textbook designed to be used in the Settlement's schools, entitled 'Gwerslyvr i Ddysgu Darllen at Wasanaeth Ysgolion y Wladva' (1878; second edition, 1881).  He published his own series of almanacs annually until 1905. \n\nR. J. Berwyn was one of Lewis Jones's loyal supporters and they were both imprisoned in 1882-3 for their part in the campaign to defend the rights of the Welsh.  Unfortunately, Berwyn's records and historical writings were lost during the floods of 1899.  He was the brother of William Lloyd Jones 'Glyn', who was also a member of the Welsh community in Patagonia.","descriptionCy":"Cafodd y gwerslyfr hwn ei ysgrifennu yn arbennig ar gyfer dibenion addysgiadol plant y Wladfa gan R. J. Berwyn (1836-1917).  Cyhoeddwyd yr argraffiad cyntaf ym 1878 ac ymddangosodd yr ailargraffiad a welir yma (a oedd yn cynnwys nifer o ychwanegiadau), ym 1881.  Lluniwyd y gyfrol gyda chymorth Thomas Pugh, Llandderfel.  Roedd y gwerslyfr yn cynnwys geirfa, gwersi, penillion, diarhebion a straeon, ynghyd √¢ rhestr o enwau Cymraeg i blant.  Hwn oedd y llyfr Cymraeg cyntaf i gael ei argraffu yn y Wladfa.\n\nGaned Richard Jones (Berwyn) yng Nglyndyfrdwy, Sir Feirionnydd.  Treuliodd gyfnodau yn Llundain a'r Unol Daleithiau, ond dychwelodd i Gymru pan glywodd am gynllun y Parch. Michael D. Jones i sefydlu gwladfa Gymreig.  Mabwysiadodd yr enw 'Berwyn' yn fuan wedi iddo ymfudo i Batagonia ym 1865.  \n\nRoedd R. J. Berwyn yn llenor ac yn gymeriad blaenllaw yn hanes y Wladfa.  Ef oedd ei chofrestrydd genedigaethau, priodasau a marwolaethau, a bu hefyd yn gyfrifol am olygu papur newydd Cymraeg cyntaf y Wladfa, sef 'Y Brut' (1868).  Daliodd nifer o swyddi cyhoeddus, gan gynnwys ysgrifennydd Cyngor y Wladfa, ysgrifennydd y llysoedd Cymraeg, postfeistr, ac athro.  Gyda chymorth Thomas Pugh, lluniodd 'Gwerslyvr i Ddysgu Darllen at Wasanaeth Ysgolion y Wladva' (1878; ail argraffiad, 1881).  Cyhoeddwyd ei almanaciau yn flynyddol hyd 1905. \n\nRoedd R. J. Berwyn yn un o gefnogwyr teyrngar Lewis Jones a carcharwyd y ddau ohonynt ym 1882-3 am eu rhan yn yr ymgyrch i ddiogelu hawliau'r Cymry.  Yn anffodus, collwyd cofnodion a'i ysgrifau hanesyddol Berwyn yn llifogydd 1899.  Roedd yn frawd i William Lloyd Jones 'Glyn' a oedd hefyd yn byw yn y Wladfa.","summary":"'Gwerslyvr Cyntav i ddysgu darllen Cymraeg at wasanaeth ysgolion y Wladva' by R. J.

Saundersfoot</strong><br /><strong>Interviewer: Hugh Morgan.</strong><br /><strong>Material included in collection:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Filmed interview recorded interview with Duncan Hilling, photographs, and short written description.</strong></p><p>Duncan Hilling was interviewed for the West Wales Veterans Archive on 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;September 2002 at his home in Saundersfoot.</p><p>Aged 96yrs old at the time of this interview Duncan eloquently provides a wonderful description of Saundersfoot during the 1930&rsquo;s and early years of the Second World War but also a vivid and at times harrowing account of the effect of the Atom Bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which end the Second World War.</p><p>Duncan was a member of the first British troops to enter Japan just a few weeks after the Atom Bombs had been dropped onto these two Japanese cities by the American Air Force. The troops from the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Mortar Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers were given no warning about the appalling dangers of radioactivity and venturing into Hiroshima and Nagasaki collected small items from the devastated cities wreckage back to their Barracks. Unsurprisingly during the years after the end of the war, cancer took its toll amongst Duncan&rsquo;s closest comrades who went with him into these cities and its hospitals. Today at the remarkable age of 96yrs Duncan is the sole survivor from this group.</p><p>The filmed footage included in Duncan&rsquo;s collection has been divided into two sections.</p><p>In Part One Duncan describes his childhood being brought up in Saundersfoot, the outbreak of WW2 and the early years the war including an aircraft crash nearby and the bombing of Pembroke Dock, Swansea, and Llanelli. He finishes Part One having volunteered and entering the RAF on 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;April 1944, to being transferred to the Army on 17th August 1944, and his initial service in India with the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Mortar Battalion of the Royal Welch (which on 10th October 1945 became renamed as the Royal Welch Fusiliers.)</p><p>In Part Two, Duncan continues with his recollections from India and then into Japan, finding the Japanese civilian population friendly and welcoming despite Japan&rsquo;s recent surrender and the end of the War. Duncan describes visiting a hospital in Hiroshima and the trauma contained within. After being in Japan for 9 months, the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Bttn RWF is then posted to Malaya and in 1947, close to demob, Duncan becomes ill and spends three months in the Military Hospital whilst his friends have already returned to England and demob. Duncan is eventually dispatched back home and during December 1947 and January 1948 is given long-overdue leave and is then placed on the Army Reserve.</p><p>Duncan describes that he was told he had three options for civilian occupation: shoemaker, horticulture, or farming. His childhood sweetheart and shortly to become his wife, Audrey, then shared her thoughts with him.

the Founder and Managing Director of Sea Trust, based in Goodwick. Over the years he has been involved in numerous surveys, including the one he recounts below.\n\nCliff asks that anyone wanting to use/cite this work contacts him beforehand to ask for permission. Cliff can be contacted at: seatrustwales@gmail.com.\n\n‚ÄúEvery time Sea Trust ventures out on one of our surveys either on a small boat like the Cartlett Lady or on the Stena Europe, there is a thrill of anticipation as we make our way offshore. Out from the Pembrokeshire coast we have the meetings of the southern Irish Sea, The North Atlantic/Celtic Sea and the Bristol Channel, their waters mixing nutrients, boosting the food chain from bottom to top, from microscopic plankton to great whales.\n\nBut nothing is static in the ocean and in these times of climate change, things can move surprisingly quickly as we naturalists have witnessed through the early years of this new millennium. It is only by getting out there as much as possible that these phenomena can be seen and recorded and compared year on year, the more surveys and the more years the better.\n\nThe morning of Sunday 27th August 2017 dawned clear and calm. Hardly a breath of wind stirred the flags in the marina as we came together for a Cartlett Lady survey out to the Celtic deep, 30 miles SW of Milford Haven. As we cleared the Haven out into the open sea, it was flat calm raising our hopes of a spectacular day... but little did we know just how good!\n\nMy cunning plan was to head out South West towards the Celtic Deep in the hope of connecting with Fin Whales, as we have in the past. And so, we set off and before long we had a pod of feeding dolphins ahead of us, probably around fifty. After recording them we pressed on.\n\nWith the Cartlett Ladies powerful engines pushing us on, we were soon 25 miles out in the Celtic Sea. We slowed down to a dawdle , cruising the area where we had located the Fins in the past. With keen eyed skipper Andy at the wheel. we scanned out to the horizon for blows.  Funnily enough our next find was a small Blue Shark, its dorsal and tail fin creating a small wiggly wake as they broke the silken surface. A little while later, the surface erupted as dark shapes broke the surface, a school of big tuna (that I first mistook as dolphins), in a feeding frenzy.\n\nAs if to top it, our next surprise was a strange blob that turned into a Leatherback Turtle, a tantalizingly brief view but as usual ace photographer Ken was on it before it disappeared into the depths. Next was more Dolphins at least a couple of hundred, that had attracted at least fifty Gannets who were sitting obviously sated, showing snow white on the ultramarine surface.\n\nA little further on, another big Tuna feeding frenzy ripped that seascape apart and Ken was on it again. I was stood on the bow of the Cartlett lady when just next to me a huge bluefin Tuna rocketed out of the water! I saw its fishy eye staring, its flashing silvery sides and hooked and serrated fins, truly a gothic monster of the deep. There and gone in a split second,. On a  a magical moment that will live with me forever!\n\nAfter an hour or so it was time to head back in an easterly course, back towards the Haven. We encountered pod after pod of dolphins along the way, to the point Sophie, had to relieve  data recorder Sophia from  recording them and in turn, Fenela relieved Sophie, as the sightings came thick and fast.

Out from the Pembrokeshire coast we have the meetings of the southern Irish Sea, The North Atlantic/Celtic Sea and the Bristol Channel, their waters mixing nutrients, boosting the food chain from bottom to top, from microscopic plankton to great whales.\n\nBut nothing is static in the ocean and in these times of climate change, things can move surprisingly quickly as we naturalists have witnessed through the early years of this new millennium. It is only by getting out there as much as possible that these phenomena can be seen and recorded and compared year on year, the more surveys and the more years the better.\n\nThe morning of Sunday 27th August 2017 dawned clear and calm. Hardly a breath of wind stirred the flags in the marina as we came together for a Cartlett Lady survey out to the Celtic deep, 30 miles SW of Milford Haven. As we cleared the Haven out into the open sea, it was flat calm raising our hopes of a spectacular day... but little did we know just how good!\n\nMy cunning plan was to head out South West towards the Celtic Deep in the hope of connecting with Fin Whales, as we have in the past. And so, we set off and before long we had a pod of feeding dolphins ahead of us, probably around fifty. After recording them we pressed on.\n\nWith the Cartlett Ladies powerful engines pushing us on, we were soon 25 miles out in the Celtic Sea. We slowed down to a dawdle , cruising the area where we had located the Fins in the past. With keen eyed skipper Andy at the wheel. we scanned out to the horizon for blows.  Funnily enough our next find was a small Blue Shark, its dorsal and tail fin creating a small wiggly wake as they broke the silken surface. A little while later, the surface erupted as dark shapes broke the surface, a school of big tuna (that I first mistook as dolphins), in a feeding frenzy.\n\nAs if to top it, our next surprise was a strange blob that turned into a Leatherback Turtle, a tantalizingly brief view but as usual ace photographer Ken was on it before it disappeared into the depths. Next was more Dolphins at least a couple of hundred, that had attracted at least fifty Gannets who were sitting obviously sated, showing snow white on the ultramarine surface.\n\nA little further on, another big Tuna feeding frenzy ripped that seascape apart and Ken was on it again. I was stood on the bow of the Cartlett lady when just next to me a huge bluefin Tuna rocketed out of the water! I saw its fishy eye staring, its flashing silvery sides and hooked and serrated fins, truly a gothic monster of the deep. There and gone in a split second,. On a  a magical moment that will live with me forever!\n\nAfter an hour or so it was time to head back in an easterly course, back towards the Haven. We encountered pod after pod of dolphins along the way, to the point Sophie, had to relieve  data recorder Sophia from  recording them and in turn, Fenela relieved Sophie, as the sightings came thick and fast. Five here, ten there and fifty and on and on. Unsurprisingly, we were all pretty made up with the trip but I was a little disappointed at failing to connect with the Fin Whales.\n\nSkipper Andy spotted it first. On a brief glance I was convinced we had a Fin Whale as the mouth broke the water then the rostrum and its long back , followed by the fin as it submerged again.

In 2008 this chapel underwent sensitive restoration and is now Grade 2 Listed, for its early character and unusual interior layout.","summary":"BURNETT'S HILL CHAPEL","title":"BURNETT'S HILL CHAPEL","titleCy":"BURNETT'S HILL CHAPEL","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/2026","uuid":"2afa307c-d870-348d-8a90-b67cf7b188dc","creationDateTo":"2005-11-23","creationDateFrom":"2005-11-23","creationDate":"23 November 2005","creator":"Robert Scourfield Collection","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-2026","group":"community","lon":"-4.863834000000","lat":"51.751593000000","licence":"All Rights Reserved","status":"published","subjects":["'Churches / Chapels / Other Places of Worship'","Chapel","Martletwy","Post Medieval"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"<p>The sentences of the Chartists.

Trawsfynydd Nuclear Power Station.\nTrawsfynydd Nuclear Power Station was constructed between 1959 and 1963 to architectural specifications by Sir Basil Spence. It started service in 1965 and its twin Magnox reactors generated electricity for 26 years before it reached the end of its service life in 1991. The first inland civil nuclear power station in the UK, it used fresh water for cooling drawn from Trawsfynydd lake, originally created in the 1920s as part of a hydro-electric project at Maentwrog.\nThe complex comprised accommodation grouped in four buildings, each of which fulfilled one of the station's distinct functions - reactor buildings, a turbine hall, fuel disposal areas and an electricity substation. These were arranged compactly and linked by covered walkways. The reactor buildings, which housed the station's twin Magnox reactors, were constructed of reinforced concrete and, at 180 feet in height, were the most dominant feature of the site. The Central Electricity Generating Board was keen to recognise that Trawsfynydd was a Welsh power station and so the practice produced a vast 'mosaic' in boulder-sized pebbles in the form of a Welsh dragon which formed the paving of the central court.\nTrawsfynydd Power Station is unique in that the power station was built inland adjacent to a lake which provided cooling water when the station was operational. The power station is set within extensive landscaped grounds designed by Sylvia Crowe, who also commented on the setting of the building to complement its wider landscape within the Snowdonia National Park. After 26 years in production, the decommissioning of Trawsfynydd began in 1991. It is expected that site clearance will be carried out over the next 100 years. The reactor buildings, which remain on the site, have been be clad to become safestore buildings.\nAll fuel has been removed from the reactors and decommissioning is well underway. 2010 saw the implementation of the Accelerated Care and Maintenance Business Case, and activity during the reporting period was focused on the delivery of an accelerated decommissioning plan.\nRef.

Cafodd ei rhoi ar waith ym 1965 a bu ei hadweithyddion Magnox dwbl yn cynhyrchu trydan am 26 blynedd cyn i'r atomfa ddod i ddiwedd ei hoes ym 1991. Trawsfynydd oedd yr atomfa sifil fewndirol gyntaf i gael ei chodi yn y DU, a deuai'r d≈µr croyw ar gyfer oeri'r adweithyddion o lyn Trawsfynydd, a gr√™wyd yn wreiddiol yn y 1920au fel rhan o gynllun trydan d≈µr ym Maentwrog.\nRoedd ar y safle bedwar gr≈µp o adeiladau, yr oedd pob un ohonynt yn cyflawni un o swyddogaethau penodol yr atomfa - adeiladau'r adweithyddion, neuadd tyrbinau, ardaloedd gwaredu tanwydd ac is-orsaf drydan. Cafodd y rhain eu trefnu'n daclus gyda'i gilydd a'u cysylltu √¢ rhodfeydd √¢ tho drostynt. Cafodd yr adeiladau lle gosodwyd adweithyddion dwbl yr orsaf eu gwneud o goncrit cyfnerth a'r rhain, a oedd yn cyrraedd uchder o 180 o droedfeddi, oedd nodwedd amlycaf y safle. Roedd y Bwrdd Cynhyrchu Trydan Canolog yn awyddus i gydnabod mai gorsaf drydan Gymreig oedd Trawsfynydd ac felly defnyddiwyd 'cerigos' maint clogfeini i greu mosaig enfawr ar ffurf draig a oedd yn rhan o bafin y cwrt canolog.\nTrawsfynydd oedd yr unig atomfa i gael ei hadeiladu ar safle mewndirol yn agos at lyn, a fu'n darparu d≈µr oeri pan oedd yr orsaf drydan yn gweithio. Mae'r atomfa wedi'i gosod mewn tiroedd wedi'u tirlunio helaeth a gynlluniwyd gan Sylvia Crowe, a nododd hefyd sut y cafodd yr adeiladau eu lleoli i ymdoddi i dirwedd ehangach Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri. Ar √¥l cynhyrchu trydan am 26 blynedd, dechreuwyd digomisiynu'r atomfa ym 1991. Disgwylir y bydd yn cymryd 100 mlynedd eto i glirio'r safle. Bu'n rhaid gorchuddio adeiladau'r adweithyddion, sy'n parhau ar y safle, i'w gwneud yn adeiladau storfa ddiogel.\nMae'r holl danwydd wedi cael ei dynnu o'r adweithyddion erbyn hyn ac mae'r gwaith digomisiynu wedi cychwyn ers tro byd. Yn 2010 cafodd yr Achos Busnes Gofal a Chynnal Cyflym ei roi ar waith, ac yn ystod y cyfnod adrodd rhoddwyd y sylw pennaf i weithredu cynllun digomisiynu cyflym.\nRef.

R.M., was the presiding magistrate, a fatal fracas between seamen led to an investigation and the ultimate remand of three prisoners of Japanese nationality, who with the man who lost his life had been employed on the tramp steamer, Earl of Elgin.\n\nThe accused, whose names and ratings were recorded as follow‚ÄîMatsuzo Kawaba, aged 25 years, fireman; Masham Kurata, aged 26 years, greaser; and Masataka Yasuji, aged 30 years, cook‚Äî were charged that at Musgrave Channel on the previous evening they did kill and slay one Robert Scarborough. The latter was described as of Scottish origin, living in London. His dead body at present lies in the mortuary Royal Victoria Hospital. District-Inspector Harrison conducted the prosecution, and the prisoners were not professionally represented.\n\nThe interpreter examined in the case gave his name Nobujuki Sada, and the oath on which he was sworn read as follows:-\n\nI declare, as in the presence of Buddha, that I am unprejudiced, and if what I shall speak shall prove false, or if by colouring truth others shall be led astray, then may the three Holy Existenies, Buddha, Dhamma, and the Pro Sangha, in whose sight I now stand, together with the devotees of the twenty-two Firmaments, punish me and also my migrating soul. \n\nWHAT THE CHIEF OFFICER SAW. \n\nFrederick Watkins, chief officer of the Earl of Elgin, was the first witness called. He stated that on the previous evening shortly before six o'clock he was having tea in company with the captain, the second officer, and the wireless operator in the cabin. They heard loud voices and some talking.\n\nMr- Harrison ‚ÄîDid you see movement on the part of some of the crew?‚Äî Yes. They formed up as if to fight, and they were told to go ashore if they wanted to fight.\n\nDid you hear that direction given?‚Äî No. but I saw several of the crew go ashore. \n\nDid you then come out the cabin?‚Äî Yes. Did you see two of the crew standing up to fight? ‚ÄîYes, the deceased and Yasuji. The latter had been paid off that afternoon.\n\nDid you see Yasuji take off his coat and leave it on a box on the quay?‚ÄîYes.\n\nDid you see Scarborough hold out his hand as if to shake hands with Yasuji?‚Äîl did. Did you see Yasukji catch the other man‚Äôs hand and give it a sudden twist? ‚ÄîYes I thought they were shaking hands before fighting.\n\nDid Scarborough reel over and fall?‚ÄîHe did.\n\nDid you then see Kawaba do anything.‚Äî He sprang at Scarborough and struck him on the back several times. \n\nDid you immediately afterward see a knife in Kawaba‚Äôs hand?‚ÄîYes, when he turned after finishing the punching. \n\nYou were on the deck of the boat at the time?‚ÄîYes, about twenty yards away. \n\nYou saw the knife in his hand plainly- Distinctly. \n\nThe Clerk of the Court‚ÄîHave you got the knife? \n\nMr. Harrison, D.I.‚ÄîNo. it is at the bottom of the sea. \n\nThe examination of the witness was resumed. \n\nDid you then see Kawaba go over towards the ship's ladder? ‚ÄîYes.  \n\nDid he run or walk?‚ÄîHe went quickly. \n\nHad he the knife then in his hand?‚ÄîYes. \n\nDid you go over towards the head of the ladder to meet him?‚Äîl did. \n\nAs he came up the ladder did you see him do anything?‚ÄîI saw him drop the knife into the water between the ship and the quay. \n\n\nDid you catch him as he came aboard?‚Äîl did, and I handed him over to the third officer. \n\nDid you go then down to where Scarborough was lying?‚ÄîYes. \n\nIn what condition did you find him?‚ÄîHe was lying on his face in a pool of blood. \n\nWas he dead or alive?‚ÄîHe was apparently dead. I felt his heart. It was not beating. \n\nDid you know if there had been quarrel between Scarborough and Yasuji?‚ÄîYes; there had been a disturbance during the day over bad cooking.\n\nThe prisoners, through the Interpreter, signified that they asked no question, and Kurata, who could speak English, added, \"My name has not been mentioned.‚Äù \n\nMr. Harrison‚ÄîThat is quite correct. We are getting on better than thought we would. \n\nThe witness, further interrogated, said that at 8-30 p.m. he picked out Kawaba and Yasuji from a number of other Japanese seamen, and identified them. \n\nDAY OF QUARRELLING. \n\nMr. Harrison‚ÄîThe next witness is a Dutchman. \n\nJacob Van Kempen, a fireman on board the Earl of Elgin, said that during the day quarrelling had been going on between the cook, Yasuji, and Scarborough. It started in the morning at about a quarter to nine, and was about the way the food was cooked. The cook was paid off in the afternoon about three o‚Äôclock. He came back about a quarter to six o‚Äôclock for his effects, and challenged Scarborough ashore to fight. The men went ashore, and witness saw Scarborough hold out his hand. Yasuji caught him, and tripped him on the quayside.\n\nThe District-Inspector‚ÄîWhat happened then?‚ÄîThe men fell in a scrimmage, and Kawaba ran from the ship with a knife in his hand, and when Scarborough came up on top Kawaba struck him about five times in the back with the knife. He also stabbed Scarborough in the side.\n\nProceeding, witness said that after the stabbing affair Kawaba ran back to the ship, and witness saw him drop the knife into the water as he went aboard. Later witness identified Kawaba and Yasuji from amongst a number of other men. Witness saw Kurata standing behind Scarborough, but did not observe him do anything.\n\nQuestioned by Kurata (through the interpreter), witness admitted having heard him (Kurata) advise Yasuji and Scarborough earlier in the day not to create trouble on board. Witness, however, could not say if he tried to separate the men when the fight commenced.\n\nNo further evidence was taken, and the prisoners were formally remanded until Friday.\n\nSource: \"FATAL BELFAST FRACAS.

Aunt G and Joanna met me. We then took a cab and drove to the Strand, where after taking tea and refreshing ourselves went to The National Gallery as it was rather a wet day. On coming out it cleared so went up Regent Street to have a look at the shops. \nThursday, May  24th\n Took a cab to Paddington and saw Joanna off  by the Severn Express. Then a bus to Whiteleys , had some refreshments in this immense confectionery department, looked well about the shops at Westbourne Grove, then took a bus to Victoria, from there to Norwood Cemetery, a place of enormous size. We stayed there for a long time inspecting the various tombs, some of which were very magnificent. Later on took a bus to Brixton, after walking about there for a time, took tram to Blackfriars, from there a bus over the bridge to Ludgate Circus, and from there bus to Liverpool Street, from thence train to Haggerstone. Called on Aunt where we sat a couple of hours. We then took train, thence bus home, after having a good treat of buses and trams. \nFriday, May 25th\nTook bus to the Brompton Oratory, walked all round. I saw them decorating for St Philip Neri, being the feast day today. We then walked to the Imperial Institute and went all over it. The latest editions were the Glass and China cases in the corridor lately opened by the Prince of Wales. The articles of Wedgewood, Crown Derby, and Swansea China, Dresden etc, were beyond description, also the elegant glass. We had refreshments in the beautiful gardens, and then went to the Indian section of the South Kensington museum, which we much enjoyed. We then walked to Sloane Street inspecting the shops, and took a bus to the Strand, and after taking tea went to the Lyceum Theatre where we had booked seats a fortnight before. The piece selected was Faust, the scenery and acting are beyond description, everyone attending with breathless attention. When the last scene rose there were cries for Irving, and cheers were given for him, at the end of the scene. Irving and Ellen Terry came to the front. The scene that attracted so much attention were four angels ascending to Heaven conveying the soul of Marguerite, whose body lay at the foot of the cross from which one Angel was pointing upwards. The house was packed, only standing room. We came home thoroughly pleased. \nSaturday, May 26th\n Went to St James's Park to see the Trooping of the Colours  which came off with great eclat and where we had a good show of Royalty. Among whom we saw the Prince and Princess of Wales, Duke and Duchess of York, Duke of Cambridge, Duchess of Edinburgh and Connaught, Princesses of\nConnaught, Princess Mary of Teck. The bands were the Queen's own, Foot Guards, Life Guards, Grenadiers, and Scotch Pipers who all marched up to Marlborough House. The crowd of pedestrians and equestrians were enormous. We then purposed going to the Park but after going in the bus the rain came on, so made up our minds to go to the Oratory, where we were in time for part of the service. Saw Cardinal Vaughan and the Bishop of Emmaus, also the Altar of St Philip Neri, which was one mass of flowers and lighted candles. The worked banners were something elegant. The place was packed and the music was very grand. Came out and walked through the Park to Hyde Park Corner and, as the weather looked so unsettled and cold, took a bus to German Reeds and heard Corney Grain in his inimitable sketch entitled  A Funny World which we much enjoyed. Came home to the Strand to dinner at 6.00 and then in for the evening, writing letters, etc. \nSunday, May 27th\n In the morning took a bus down to St Margaret's Church, Westminster where we had a splendid sermon from Canon Farrar upon St Augustine and Venerable Bede. Singing and music very good and most hearty. We then walked home and had dinner, after which we took bus to St Paul's for the afternoon service and had a good seat near the pulpit. It was the day for the judges and they and the Lord Mayor, the ex-Lord Mayors, Council in mauve silk gowns, High Sheriff, etc walked in procession up the Aisle. The place was packed. The anthem ‚Äúwhoso dwelleth‚Äù was beautifully rendered by the choir, as also were the chants. The sermon was preached by Rev Canon Scot Holland who took for his text, VI Chap St Luke, 31st verse. It was a lovely sermon and we heard every word. We then got out at the North door, and were in time to see the Lord Mayor's coach and other carriages pass by. It then began to rain so took a bus home, found it had cleared up, so took a turn on the embankment and in to tea, only in time before the rain which came down in torrents. \nMonday, May 28th\n Walked to the Academy with Cousin Emily where we spent about three hours. Some of the pictures were very nice but, of course, it would take too long to describe them. We came out and had some refreshments and by the time we reached our lodgings it rained heavily. After clearing , we walked to Ludgate Circus, from there took bus to Broad Street, and then train to Dalston. Then walked up to Palatine Road, Stoke Newington and had tea with Cousin Millie. We came home about 9 o'clock and after paying a visit to our lodgings, and sat chatting by the fire previous to our going to bed. \nTuesday, May 29th\n In the morning took a bus to Olympia to see the performance of Constantinople. Arrived there in good time and secured good seats. The performance on the central stage was most gorgeous and stupendous computed to have 2000 performers. The last scene when the state barges came in, and the glass crescents lighted was raised in the centre, with all the dancers singing the chorus of Glory was a scene that must be seen to be described. Returning to the City which was laid out, with tastefully decorated shops, of inlaid goods, Turkish embroideries, olive wood articles from Jerusalem, served by the most part by natives. Cigarette stalls with native girls, with lovely  faces, in broken English trying to dispose of their wares, were pretty in the extreme. There was also a representation of a Turkish mosque with prayer carpets etc. Also a splendid representation of the Turkish Harem fitted up with elegant cushions, couches, embroidered rugs, and pretty women elegantly attired. There was also a very nice carpet factory, to which we were admitted by visiting cards. There we saw the natives weaving the Turkey carpets. We ascended the Galata Tower from which we saw a splendid Panorama of Constantinople indeed one would scarcely think it was only a painting. The fairy gardens are exquisite, but the time was short and the weather indifferent so could only take short survey. There are dozens of arches made of glass lustres which when illuminated must look like fairyland. Beds of roses, fountains of running water and native bands enlivened the scene. We went in one of the caiques for a row to the thousands Columns, which is supposed to be a subterranean passage under the city on the Bosphorous lighted by lamps, set in niches of the wall here and there. It was said the water was not very deep but we should consider it deep enough that a ducking would be very unpleasant. We came out about 5 o'clock and were just fortunate to get a bus, before the rain came down. So we came to Charing Cross, and after looking over some purchases we had made, it being then fine, we took a turn up Regent Street, returning about  7.30. Had tea, came in lighted the fire and sat down after an enjoyable day. \nWednesday, May 30th\nIn the morning took bus to Victoria and from there train to Clapham Junction;  to Emanuel School   and took Harry out for the day. He came at 11. 30, we went into the city and up to St Paul‚Äôs. Harry   never having   seen   much   of   the building,  we made a good inspection.  We were able to see Wellington's Funeral Car also his tomb and to go behind the reredos which is very magnificent, the marble being so beautiful.  We then had tickets for the crypt which is part of Old St Paul‚Äôs and where we saw Sir Bartle Frere, Lord Nottage the Lord Mayor who died in office, also Collingwood, Northests, Dean Milman, Nelson, etc. We then went out, and had something to eat. But the rain came down so heavily that we had to go back to the cathedral to stay for the shower to pass off. We then walked through Old Bailey on to the Viaduct, took a bus from Holborn Circus to Regent Circus walked down Regent Street and a heavy shower of hail had to take refuge in St James Hall. After it cleared went to the Strand and after taking some refreshments took Harry by bus to Victoria saw him into the train for Clapham Junction and then took bus back to Charing Cross, took a walk up the Strand and after having dined, came in for the evening. \nThursday, May  31st\n Walked to Wellington street and from there took bus to Waterloo and from thence train to Windsor. Went into the Albert Chapel, a magnificent building, the whole being composed of different coloured marble floor and seats. It is beyond description by diary. We then went to St George's Chapel, the tomb there to the Princess Charlotte in the Urswick Chapel and the Prince Imperial in the Bray Chapel. The Duke of Kent and also the late King of Hanover in the Nave, were splendid works of art. On entering the choir one cannot but be struck by the beauty of the place as a whole. The elegant ceiling, the carving of the stalls, the elegant marble reredos, in memory of Prince Consort (the ascension) with the elegantly stained glass window above, must be seen to be appreciated and admired. Although not able to describe the Albert Memorial Chapel I must just mention that the centre portion of the building is taken up by the magnificent marble tombs with recumbent figures:  To the memory of the late lamented Prince Consort and The late Duke of Albany. The centre tomb is colour Porphyry to the memory of the late Duke of Clarence whose body lies in the sarcophagus. We then went to the state apartments which the guide I bought explains at full length. We also saw the Jubilee Presents. We then took a walk on the North Terrace from where panoramic views are to be seen. Took a turn as far as the Long Walk, where can be seen the Queen's Private Apartments. Then went to see the stables and a very heavy thunderstorm came on. After it cleared went as far as the bridge to have a view of the castle from the river, saw the Eton boys practising previous to the 4th June. Went then down the Datchet road and home to Waterloo about 6 o'clock. Then took a bus to Regent Circus walked about looking at the different shops and came by bus about 8. \nFriday, June 1st\n In the morning took bus to Holborn and made several purchases and came home and then took bus to London Bridge station and from there train to Forest Hill to see Aunt Emma, after having tea, and chatting a bit, it was time for us to leave and we got home about 9 and had something to eat and in for the night. \nSaturday, June 2nd\n In the morning took a walk up the Strand and turned in to St Mary's Church which has a very fine ceiling and is a nice church, also St Clement‚Äôs which we did not much care for. Walked as far as Ludgate Circus then came back had something to eat and went to a matinee at the Haymarket entitled A Bunch of Violets, which we enjoyed very much. The acting of Mr and Mrs Tree, Miss Lily Hanbury and Mr Lionel Brough was splendid. Came home and Aunt G had a very bad headache and was very sick so stayed in the rest of the evening. \nSunday, June  3rd\n In the morning went to St Martin‚Äôs Church by myself (as Aunt G had a bad headache) heard the Archdeacon of London on the motto Nobless Oblige as he took for his text To whosoever much is given, from him shall much be required. In the afternoon we took a turn in St James Park, up St James Street, through Piccadilly, home by the Embankment and in to tea. Stayed in after reading. \nMonday, June  4th\nVery wet in the morning cleared about 11, so then went to Westminster Abbey, had a good look round there, then we walked to Trafalgar Square and from there took bus to Tottenham Court Road, walked down through Oxford Street, where we had lunch and then on to the Viaduct, then into Paternoster Row, and through Cheapside to Broad Street station. Took train from there to Haggerston, called on Aunt, had tea and went with them to have a look at their bazaar. Bought a few things and then went to call at 60 Palatine Road, found them out so walked back to Haggerston Station, and came by train to Broad Street. From there bus to the Strand, had supper in for the night.","descriptionCy":"Wednesday, May 23rd\nStarted from Carmarthen by 7.10 a.m. train and arrived at Paddington after a pleasant journey about 2.30. Aunt G and Joanna met me. We then took a cab and drove to the Strand, where after taking tea and refreshing ourselves went to The National Gallery as it was rather a wet day. On coming out it cleared so went up Regent Street to have a look at the shops. \nThursday, May  24th\n Took a cab to Paddington and saw Joanna off  by the Severn Express. Then a bus to Whiteleys , had some refreshments in this immense confectionery department, looked well about the shops at Westbourne Grove, then took a bus to Victoria, from there to Norwood Cemetery, a place of enormous size. We stayed there for a long time inspecting the various tombs, some of which were very magnificent. Later on took a bus to Brixton, after walking about there for a time, took tram to Blackfriars, from there a bus over the bridge to Ludgate Circus, and from there bus to Liverpool Street, from thence train to Haggerstone. Called on Aunt where we sat a couple of hours. We then took train, thence bus home, after having a good treat of buses and trams. \nFriday, May 25th\nTook bus to the Brompton Oratory, walked all round. I saw them decorating for St Philip Neri, being the feast day today. We then walked to the Imperial Institute and went all over it. The latest editions were the Glass and China cases in the corridor lately opened by the Prince of Wales. The articles of Wedgewood, Crown Derby, and Swansea China, Dresden etc, were beyond description, also the elegant glass. We had refreshments in the beautiful gardens, and then went to the Indian section of the South Kensington museum, which we much enjoyed. We then walked to Sloane Street inspecting the shops, and took a bus to the Strand, and after taking tea went to the Lyceum Theatre where we had booked seats a fortnight before. The piece selected was Faust, the scenery and acting are beyond description, everyone attending with breathless attention. When the last scene rose there were cries for Irving, and cheers were given for him, at the end of the scene. Irving and Ellen Terry came to the front. The scene that attracted so much attention were four angels ascending to Heaven conveying the soul of Marguerite, whose body lay at the foot of the cross from which one Angel was pointing upwards. The house was packed, only standing room. We came home thoroughly pleased. \nSaturday, May 26th\n Went to St James's Park to see the Trooping of the Colours  which came off with great eclat and where we had a good show of Royalty. Among whom we saw the Prince and Princess of Wales, Duke and Duchess of York, Duke of Cambridge, Duchess of Edinburgh and Connaught, Princesses of\nConnaught, Princess Mary of Teck. The bands were the Queen's own, Foot Guards, Life Guards, Grenadiers, and Scotch Pipers who all marched up to Marlborough House. The crowd of pedestrians and equestrians were enormous. We then purposed going to the Park but after going in the bus the rain came on, so made up our minds to go to the Oratory, where we were in time for part of the service. Saw Cardinal Vaughan and the Bishop of Emmaus, also the Altar of St Philip Neri, which was one mass of flowers and lighted candles. The worked banners were something elegant. The place was packed and the music was very grand. Came out and walked through the Park to Hyde Park Corner and, as the weather looked so unsettled and cold, took a bus to German Reeds and heard Corney Grain in his inimitable sketch entitled  A Funny World which we much enjoyed. Came home to the Strand to dinner at 6.00 and then in for the evening, writing letters, etc. \nSunday, May 27th\n In the morning took a bus down to St Margaret's Church, Westminster where we had a splendid sermon from Canon Farrar upon St Augustine and Venerable Bede. Singing and music very good and most hearty. We then walked home and had dinner, after which we took bus to St Paul's for the afternoon service and had a good seat near the pulpit. It was the day for the judges and they and the Lord Mayor, the ex-Lord Mayors, Council in mauve silk gowns, High Sheriff, etc walked in procession up the Aisle. The place was packed. The anthem ‚Äúwhoso dwelleth‚Äù was beautifully rendered by the choir, as also were the chants. The sermon was preached by Rev Canon Scot Holland who took for his text, VI Chap St Luke, 31st verse. It was a lovely sermon and we heard every word. We then got out at the North door, and were in time to see the Lord Mayor's coach and other carriages pass by. It then began to rain so took a bus home, found it had cleared up, so took a turn on the embankment and in to tea, only in time before the rain which came down in torrents. \nMonday, May 28th\n Walked to the Academy with Cousin Emily where we spent about three hours. Some of the pictures were very nice but, of course, it would take too long to describe them. We came out and had some refreshments and by the time we reached our lodgings it rained heavily. After clearing , we walked to Ludgate Circus, from there took bus to Broad Street, and then train to Dalston. Then walked up to Palatine Road, Stoke Newington and had tea with Cousin Millie. We came home about 9 o'clock and after paying a visit to our lodgings, and sat chatting by the fire previous to our going to bed. \nTuesday, May 29th\n In the morning took a bus to Olympia to see the performance of Constantinople. Arrived there in good time and secured good seats. The performance on the central stage was most gorgeous and stupendous computed to have 2000 performers. The last scene when the state barges came in, and the glass crescents lighted was raised in the centre, with all the dancers singing the chorus of Glory was a scene that must be seen to be described. Returning to the City which was laid out, with tastefully decorated shops, of inlaid goods, Turkish embroideries, olive wood articles from Jerusalem, served by the most part by natives. Cigarette stalls with native girls, with lovely  faces, in broken English trying to dispose of their wares, were pretty in the extreme. There was also a representation of a Turkish mosque with prayer carpets etc. Also a splendid representation of the Turkish Harem fitted up with elegant cushions, couches, embroidered rugs, and pretty women elegantly attired. There was also a very nice carpet factory, to which we were admitted by visiting cards. There we saw the natives weaving the Turkey carpets. We ascended the Galata Tower from which we saw a splendid Panorama of Constantinople indeed one would scarcely think it was only a painting. The fairy gardens are exquisite, but the time was short and the weather indifferent so could only take short survey. There are dozens of arches made of glass lustres which when illuminated must look like fairyland. Beds of roses, fountains of running water and native bands enlivened the scene. We went in one of the caiques for a row to the thousands Columns, which is supposed to be a subterranean passage under the city on the Bosphorous lighted by lamps, set in niches of the wall here and there. It was said the water was not very deep but we should consider it deep enough that a ducking would be very unpleasant. We came out about 5 o'clock and were just fortunate to get a bus, before the rain came down. So we came to Charing Cross, and after looking over some purchases we had made, it being then fine, we took a turn up Regent Street, returning about  7.30. Had tea, came in lighted the fire and sat down after an enjoyable day. \nWednesday, May 30th\nIn the morning took bus to Victoria and from there train to Clapham Junction;  to Emanuel School   and took Harry out for the day. He came at 11. 30, we went into the city and up to St Paul‚Äôs. Harry   never having   seen   much   of   the building,  we made a good inspection.  We were able to see Wellington's Funeral Car also his tomb and to go behind the reredos which is very magnificent, the marble being so beautiful.  We then had tickets for the crypt which is part of Old St Paul‚Äôs and where we saw Sir Bartle Frere, Lord Nottage the Lord Mayor who died in office, also Collingwood, Northests, Dean Milman, Nelson, etc. We then went out, and had something to eat. But the rain came down so heavily that we had to go back to the cathedral to stay for the shower to pass off. We then walked through Old Bailey on to the Viaduct, took a bus from Holborn Circus to Regent Circus walked down Regent Street and a heavy shower of hail had to take refuge in St James Hall. After it cleared went to the Strand and after taking some refreshments took Harry by bus to Victoria saw him into the train for Clapham Junction and then took bus back to Charing Cross, took a walk up the Strand and after having dined, came in for the evening. \nThursday, May  31st\n Walked to Wellington street and from there took bus to Waterloo and from thence train to Windsor. Went into the Albert Chapel, a magnificent building, the whole being composed of different coloured marble floor and seats. It is beyond description by diary. We then went to St George's Chapel, the tomb there to the Princess Charlotte in the Urswick Chapel and the Prince Imperial in the Bray Chapel. The Duke of Kent and also the late King of Hanover in the Nave, were splendid works of art. On entering the choir one cannot but be struck by the beauty of the place as a whole. The elegant ceiling, the carving of the stalls, the elegant marble reredos, in memory of Prince Consort (the ascension) with the elegantly stained glass window above, must be seen to be appreciated and admired.

There was only a few men there - two packing, two mechanics and the manager. There was music on the factory floor, and the boys would choose what station they'd listen to - like Workers' Playtime and the news.

This was much bigger than Mona Products and she was working on the laminations and making tops for sports cars and leather covers. She was much happier in Ferranti's, lot more fun, and a better wage plus bonuses. Beryl was there until 1968, when she went to Hotpoint for a few months. She didn't like Hotpoint and returned to Ferranti, getting married around this time and stopping work when she had children.","descriptionCy":"Aeth Beryl i Mona Products yn syth o'r ysgol yn 1958.

The spot where Llywelyn fell was marked in 1902 by a stone obelisk, but this was replaced in 1956 by a block of granite (from Trefor Quarry in Llywelyn's native Caernarfonshire) embedded in a plinth set on a low mound.\n\nThe battle of Irfon Bridge between the forces of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, prince of Gwynedd and Edward I forces near Builth was a decisive engagement determining the direction of the history of medieval Wales. Its importance comes from the fact that at the end of the battle, Llywelyn was dead and with it the possibility, at that date, of an independent Wales. Thus the event appears in nearly all the contemporary Welsh and Latin chronicles as well as correspondence between the king, royal officials and churchmen.
