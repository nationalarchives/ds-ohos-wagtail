Christ's College was originally the chapel of a Dominican friary. It was changed, in 1531 into a seat of learning, under a dean and nineteen prebendaries, and is now attached to a diocesan college of Lampeter; has an antique stone cross, and monuments of several bishops; and includes buildings in the monastic style, of imposing aspect, erected in 1864, at a cost of £10,000.

The chapel is a fine example of thirteenth century work, though like all the medieval buildings it was much restored by Gilbert Scott in the nineteenth century. More remarkable survivals are the two halls with their fine fifteenth century open timber roofs. Of the cloister, chapter house and other monastic buildings nothing remains but their position can be deduced from documents. In the 1530s momentous changes affected England and Wales. Henry VIII brought all of Wales under his control; this involved the creation of new Welsh counties, including Breconshire. At the same time the King made himself the Head of the Church and then dissolved the monasteries. This combination of events resulted in the foundation of  'the College of Christ of Brecknock' in 1541 to provide education in this area and thus would 'the Welsh rudeness soon be framed to English civility'!

(Refers to engraving above) Christ College Church is situated in the suburb of St David's, on the banks of the Usk, at a short distance from the bridge. The history of the original foundation at this place is not known. It is ascertained to have been a monastery of Black Friars, with an apportionment church dedicated to St Nicholas. The present college church is only sixty-three feet in length by twenty-four in breadth, and comprises merely the choir and chancel of the original edifice.

Conventual church of Dominican Friary, dedicated to St Nicholas, founded before 1269, attached to secular college from 1541. The Ordnance Survey 1:500 map of Brecon (1888) depicts remains of the nave with north aisle. This is 80 m east-west by 32 m. The former chancel, adapted as college chapel, is 20 m by 10 m. Three main periods of restoration, 17th century, 1860s, and 1926. Early English style. The chancel of the church of the Friary is now incorporated into St Nicholas's Chapel. Lancet windows. Sedilia under trefoil canopies, partly rebuilt. Seventeenth century choir stalls. The nave was ruinous by the 17th century, and the remains lie to the southwest of the chapel. Originally 88' x 27'. Northwest door remains, with round-headed arch with Romanesque style moulding.

The west end of the chapel is filled up by a solid wall with deeply moulded entrance, which has been surmounted by a bell-turret, and enclosed by an ante chapel, in which are contained some interesting monuments, especially one in memory of the Lucys (see interior photographs, below). The remains of the nave consist of the main walls up to the height of the window-cills, and a part of the main arcade on the north side, with a circular-headed north doorway. A portion of the east end of the north aisle was restored some years ago, and is used as a vestry.

Christ's College was originally the chapel of a Dominican friary. It was changed, in 1531 into a seat of learning, under a dean and nineteen prebendaries, and is now attached to a diocesan college of Lampeter; has an antique stone cross, and monuments of several bishops; and includes buildings in the monastic style, of imposing aspect, erected in 1864, at a cost of £10,000.

The chapel is a fine example of thirteenth century work, though like all the medieval buildings it was much restored by Gilbert Scott in the nineteenth century. More remarkable survivals are the two halls with their fine fifteenth century open timber roofs. Of the cloister, chapter house and other monastic buildings nothing remains but their position can be deduced from documents. In the 1530s momentous changes affected England and Wales. Henry VIII brought all of Wales under his control; this involved the creation of new Welsh counties, including Breconshire. At the same time the King made himself the Head of the Church and then dissolved the monasteries. This combination of events resulted in the foundation of  'the College of Christ of Brecknock' in 1541 to provide education in this area and thus would 'the Welsh rudeness soon be framed to English civility'!

Rawle 1813, in Rees, 1815) Note the absence of the bell tower.\n\nNote 4. (Refers to engraving above) Christ College Church is situated in the suburb of St David's, on the banks of the Usk, at a short distance from the bridge. The history of the original foundation at this place is not known. It is ascertained to have been a monastery of Black Friars, with an apportionment church dedicated to St Nicholas. The present college church is only sixty-three feet in length by twenty-four in breadth, and comprises merely the choir and chancel of the original edifice.

Conventual church of Dominican Friary, dedicated to St Nicholas, founded before 1269, attached to secular college from 1541. The Ordnance Survey 1:500 map of Brecon (1888) depicts remains of the nave with north aisle. This is 80 m east-west by 32 m. The former chancel, adapted as college chapel, is 20 m by 10 m. Three main periods of restoration, 17th century, 1860s, and 1926. Early English style. The chancel of the church of the Friary is now incorporated into St Nicholas's Chapel. Lancet windows. Sedilia under trefoil canopies, partly rebuilt. Seventeenth century choir stalls. The nave was ruinous by the 17th century, and the remains lie to the southwest of the chapel. Originally 88' x 27'. Northwest door remains, with round-headed arch with Romanesque style moulding.

The west end of the chapel is filled up by a solid wall with deeply moulded entrance, which has been surmounted by a bell-turret, and enclosed by an ante chapel, in which are contained some interesting monuments, especially one in memory of the Lucys (see interior photographs, below). The remains of the nave consist of the main walls up to the height of the window-cills, and a part of the main arcade on the north side, with a circular-headed north doorway. A portion of the east end of the north aisle was restored some years ago, and is used as a vestry.

It was still quite similar to English, and these two languages assimilated in the Viking-settled areas of northern and eastern England. There are many place-names of Norse origin around the coasts of Wales.The audio extract is from a Norse skaldic poem by Þorkell hamarskáld celebrating the victory by Magnus Barelegs at the Battle of the Menai Straits (AD1081). In 1081 a combined Welsh and Norwegian force defeated the Normans at the Battle of the Menai Straits. Viking court poet Þorkell hamarskáld celebrates the victory, in particular the role of Norwegian king Magnós berfœttr (Magnus Barelegs). The poem would have been composed and performed orally around or soon after AD1100. Transcription of the audio passage:Dunði broddr á brynju. Bragningr skaut af magni. Sveigði allvaldr Egða Alm.

The tower [shown right] could be basically 14th century with 15th century alterations on the basis of its plainness and a blocked east window. Most of building claimed to be Late Perpendicular of about the 1480s. However there is evidence that the chancel was added on, and the mixture of windows in the nave suggests extra fenestration was inserted. There is little sign of any Victorian rebuilding except perhaps on the north wall of the nave. Internally, there is an early medieval stone and the cast of another, a significantly early font, and the village stocks.

Otherwise it and the big nave and chancel mostly have features of circa 1480-1520. Three bays of the old screen were placed in the opening between the tower and nave in 1869. In the south wall is a shallow tomb recess. There is a pillar stone with Ogham symbols and a plaster replica of the Llywel Stone, now in the British Museum. There are stocks of 1798 under the tower, and there is a monument to Sybil Morgan, circa 1600.

The parish church stands in an isolated part, but with half a dozen houses in its immediate vicinity, although there are now to be seen the ruins of several others. Within the sacred edifice everything is a model of good order and cleanliness. The rood loft has disappeared , but the door leading up to it, and the door in the wall above still remain. The chancel is decently paved with tiles, and the nave is covered with wood; no monuments are anywhere to be seen on the ground. The reredos [below] is of painted tiles, and was erected at the cost of D. T. Jeffreys, Esq., to the memory of his uncle, D. Jeffreys Powell, Esq., in 1888. The east window is of painted glass, and was erected to the memory of Lewis Powell, Esq., M.D., M.R.I., by his sister Sybil in 1872.

Although its founder was St Llwyel, the church is dedicated to St David, because of a struggle in the 13th century between the bishops of St David and Llandaff during which Llywel Church was sequestrated by the bishop of St David's. It was at this time that the name of the church was changed from Llywel to Llantrisant – the Church of the Three Saints.

[The church] is said to have originally been dedicated to three saints: David, Darn (Paternus), and Teilo; and known as Llantrisant. Its name was changed when it was granted to the Chapter of Saint David sometime between 1203 and 1229.

The tower [shown right] could be basically 14th century with 15th century alterations on the basis of its plainness and a blocked east window. Most of building claimed to be Late Perpendicular of about the 1480s. However there is evidence that the chancel was added on, and the mixture of windows in the nave suggests extra fenestration was inserted. There is little sign of any Victorian rebuilding except perhaps on the north wall of the nave. Internally, there is an early medieval stone and the cast of another, a significantly early font, and the village stocks.

Otherwise it and the big nave and chancel mostly have features of circa 1480-1520. Three bays of the old screen were placed in the opening between the tower and nave in 1869. In the south wall is a shallow tomb recess. There is a pillar stone with Ogham symbols and a plaster replica of the Llywel Stone, now in the British Museum. There are stocks of 1798 under the tower, and there is a monument to Sybil Morgan, circa 1600.

The rood screen is a 20th century addition. \n\nNote 3. The parish church stands in an isolated part, but with half a dozen houses in its immediate vicinity, although there are now to be seen the ruins of several others. Within the sacred edifice everything is a model of good order and cleanliness. The rood loft has disappeared , but the door leading up to it, and the door in the wall above still remain. The chancel is decently paved with tiles, and the nave is covered with wood; no monuments are anywhere to be seen on the ground. The reredos [below] is of painted tiles, and was erected at the cost of D. T. Jeffreys, Esq., to the memory of his uncle, D. Jeffreys Powell, Esq., in 1888. The east window is of painted glass, and was erected to the memory of Lewis Powell, Esq., M.D., M.R.I., by his sister Sybil in 1872.

Although its founder was St Llwyel, the church is dedicated to St David, because of a struggle in the 13th century between the bishops of St David and Llandaff during which Llywel Church was sequestrated by the bishop of St David's. It was at this time that the name of the church was changed from Llywel to Llantrisant – the Church of the Three Saints.  [Source: St Davids Church Llywel, by Peter Maddox (from the writings of Canon Josiah Jones-Davies, Vicar of Llywel 1947-82), Church in Wales Publications, Penarth, undated] \n\nNote 5. [The church] is said to have originally been dedicated to three saints: David, Darn (Paternus), and Teilo; and known as Llantrisant. Its name was changed when it was granted to the Chapter of Saint David sometime between 1203 and 1229.

In the clip, Herman talks about the religious services at Gwrych Castle.\n\n<strong>Herman Rothman – a short biography.</strong>\n\nHerman Rothman was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1924 to Polish Jewish parents. He arrived in Britain as a refugee on the Kindertransport in August 1939 and went to the hachshara (agricultural training centre) at Gwrych Castle, Abergale. He later joined the British Army, serving in Western Europe, and was the first person to translate Hitler’s will after it was discovered hidden in the shoulder pad of a leading Nazi. He later became a lawyer in London.\n\n<strong>About Gwrych Castle. </strong>\n\nBetween 1939 and 1941, Gwrych Castle in Abergele, Denbighshire, was the home to 200 Jewish refugee children who had fled from Nazi-occupied Europe. The castle was used as an agricultural training centre, set up by Zionist organisations, in preparation for youths to emigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel). Youth Aliyah and Bachad were two of the organisations that sponsored some of the children who stayed here. Following Nazi persecution in Germany, approximately 20 of these training centres were created throughout Great Britain and Gwrych Castle would become the largest. \n\nUse of the castle was offered for free by the owner, Lord Dundonald, since it was in a very poor condition. The amenities at the castle were restricted due to most of the rooms being unfit to live in. Religious studies and agricultural work kept the children busy but sports, outdoor activities and social gatherings were also encouraged.\n\n<strong>Transcript</strong>\n\nIt was a…an Orthodox religious establishment. Everybody – every member could read, of course, fluent Hebrew, and we conducted the services – very, very lovely services.

His parents were Wolf and Sara Weil. He had one older brother, Julius, who was born on 11 October 1925. The family lived in a small apartment, which was made up of two bedrooms and a kitchen. Sara was a housewife and Wolf was an upholsterer and furniture maker. \n\nArnold attended the liberal Lützov Straße Jewish Elementary School in Köln [Cologne]. The family did not have any motor transport, so they had to get around on foot. Because of this, Arnold and his brother Julius did not have much contact as Julius spent a lot of time travelling to and from religious studies classes as well as his school – Jawne High School – which was attached to the synagogue around 45 minutes from their home. However, the brothers did play together and according to Julius, Arnold was a very sweet-looking boy.\n\nAfter the pogroms of Kristallnacht on 9-10 November 1938, Arnold’s father – Wolf – was arrested and the family did not see him again. In January 1939, when Arnold was 9 years old, his brother Julius was sent to Britain on a Kindertransport, the evacuation organised by the headmaster of his school. Arnold started work on 12 July 1942, aged 12, as an apprentice electrical engineer.\n\nIn May 1944, Henrich Himmler ordered the liquidation of the Łódź Ghetto. Between 23 June and 14 July, around 7,200 people were transported to the Chełmno Extermination Camp. Arnold and his mother were amongst those transported. He died on 7 July 1944, aged 14.\n\nAdapted from article researched and written by Catherine Le Ruez, JHASW/CHIDC volunteer.\n\n<strong>About Kristallnacht.</strong>\n\nKristallnacht, literally, ‘Night of Crystal’, is often referred to as the ‘Night of Broken Glass’. The name refers to violent anti-Jewish pogroms, which took place on 9-10 November 1938 across Germany, Austria, and the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia. The violent mobs destroyed hundreds of synagogues and burned and desecrated Jewish religious artifacts. Around 7,500 Jewish-owned businesses, homes, and schools were plundered, and 91 Jews were murdered. During the pogrom, 30,000 Jewish men were arrested in sent to concentration camps. \n\n<strong>Sources.</strong>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jhasw-heritage.com/narratives/book.php?title=Arnold%20Weil\">Jewish History Association of South Wales, Arnold Weil (2021) </a> [accessed 21 January 2022] \n\n<a href=\"https://www.ushmm.org/collections/bibliography/kristallnacht\">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Bibliographies: Kristallnacht </a> [accessed 19 January 2022] \n\n<a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/kristallnacht\">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Holocaust Encyclopedia: Kristallnacht (2019) </a> [accessed 19 January 2021]",
